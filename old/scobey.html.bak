<h2>The Story of Scobey</h2>
<p>
F.E. Scobey served as Director of the U.S. Mint from
March, 1922, to September, 1923.  He and Warren Harding enjoyed
fishing, poker playing, and golfing together, and Scobey's
loyal friendship (and campaign contributions) resulted in his
appointment as Director under Harding's administration, despite any apparent
qualifications.  His brief stint at the Mint is notable for
the fact that "he did little damage."
