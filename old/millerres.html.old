<h1>John Miller--Research Statement</h1>
<hr>

<p>
Questions about the origin of markets and trading
institutions, the effect of learning on behavior,
and the dynamics of technological change and organizations, are central to our
understanding of social worlds. 

<p>
My research focuses on the complex adaptive behavior that emerges in social
systems. The goal
of this work is to formulate principles by which complex aggregate patterns
emerge from the simple interactions of individual adaptive agents. Implicit in
this goal is a challenge to the typical reductionist scientific hypothesis.

<p>
The nonlinear and disequilibrium nature of complex systems necessitates new
methodological and theoretical directions. Methodologically, computational
methods are currently required to model such systems.
Theoretically, standard analytic tools based on both linearity and equilibrium
behavior, are ill-tuned to further our understanding of complex systems. Thus,
new approaches that emphasize nonlinearities and dynamics are needed.

<p>
One technique for understanding the behavior of complex adaptive systems is the
analysis of computer models composed of artificial adaptive agents. Unlike much
previous work with computational models, the techniques I use (e.g. genetic
algorithms) only require specification of general behavioral frameworks for the
agents (e.g. a broad class of potential strategies). Therefore, my models often
exhibit emergent behavior which was previously unanticipated by the modeler.
These methods allow the analysis of flexible, yet precise, models of
well-defined agents in an environment that can be easily and rapidly replicated
and recovered. The ability to interact directly with such open-ended models
allows one to quickly generate, develop and test new hypotheses. 

<p>
A primary research focus is the use of artificial adaptive agent models to
analyze social phenomena. Using these models, my colleagues and I have explored
the emergence of cooperation in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, the adaptation
of strategy in two-person games, bidding behavior in auction markets, the
origin of money as a medium of exchange and spatial voting behavior in
two-party elections. We've also designed and organized an international
computerized double auction tournament. This tournament allows us to create
&quotartificial worlds&quot of trading 
agents from which we can explore a variety of
theoretical and practical issues.

<p>
The development of general mathematical models
of the dynamical behavior of complex adaptive systems has also been a research
focus. The goal
of this work is the precise mathematical characterization of the dynamic
behavior of complex adaptive systems. This work, which incorporates results
from theoretical physics and chemistry, attempts to find mathematical models
that unify seemingly disparate adaptive systems.

<p>
Although the approach employed here differs in many ways from traditional
methods, I believe it will provide insight to long-standing problems. Using the
methods outlined above, previously inaccessible, yet fundamental, questions are
becoming amenable to analysis.
