Here is a brief explanation of some of the features and questions you may have 
about the Alpha Message Board.<hr>

<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>

<a name="qm">What do [Q] and [M] stand for?</a><p>
The [Q] and [M] indicate Question and Message, respectively.  This indicates 
to you whether their post is in the form of a general message or a question.  
You can indicate this by choosing one of the options in the pull down menu on 
the main post screen.<p><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
Yes, you can embed html tags anywhere in your post.  I have included the 
option of allowing you to put in a link and a picture in case you were not 
familiar with html markup, but still wanted to add a link.  Keep in mind that 
your address will already be made into a mailto: link and therefore you should 
not add any html markup around it.<p><hr><p>
<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a

free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a
