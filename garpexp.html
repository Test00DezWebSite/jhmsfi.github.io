<strong> Your answers are completely anonymous </strong>.

<p>
In this experiment you are asked to make a series of choices
about how to divide a set of tokens between yourself and one
other subject on the net. You and the other subject will be
paired randomly and you <em>will not </em> be told each
other's identity.

<p>
As you divide the tokens, you and the other subject will each
earn points.
<p>
Each choice you make is similar to the following:
<p>
<form method="POST" action="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htbin-post/post-query">
Divide 50 tokens: <strong> Hold </strong> 
<input name="trash" size=4 maxsize=2>
@ 1 point each, and 
<strong> Pass </strong> 
<input name="trash" size=4 maxsize=2>
@ 2 points each.
</form>

<p>
In this choice you must divide 50 tokens.  You can keep all the
tokens, keep some and pass some, or pass all the tokens.   In
this example, you will receive 1 point for every token you hold,
and the other player will receive 2 points for every token you
pass.  For example, if you hold 50 and pass 0 tokens, you will
receive 50 points, and the other
player will receive no points.  If you hold 0 tokens and
pass 50, you will receive 0 points and the other player will receive
50 x 2 or 100 points.  However,
you could choose any number between 0 and 50 to hold.  For
instance, you could choose to hold 29 tokens and pass 21.  In
this case you would earn 29 points,
and the other subject would receive 21 x 2 or 42 points.

<p>
Here is another example:

<form method="POST" action="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htbin-post/post-query">
<p>
Divide 40 
tokens: <strong> Hold </strong> 
<input name="trash" size=4 maxsize=2>
@ 3 
points each, and 
<strong> Pass </strong> 
<input name="trash" size=4 maxsize=2>
@ 1 
point each.
</form>
<p>
In this example every token you hold earns you 3 points, and
every token you pass earns the other subject 1 point.
<p>

<hr>
<strong>Important Note </strong>: In all cases you can choose
any number to hold and any number to pass, but the number of
tokens you hold plus the number of tokens you pass 
<em> must </em> equal the total number of tokens to divide.

<p>
<hr>

<p>
You will be asked to make 8 allocation decisions like the
examples we just discussed.  
After all the decision forms have been collected, we will
shuffle them and randomly pair your form with that of
another subject in this experiment.  We will then randomly
select <em>one </em> of your decisions to carry
out.  You will then get the points you allocated in the `hold'
portion of your decision, and the other subject will get the
points you allocated on the `pass' portion of your decision.  You
will then be paired again with a different subject in the
experiment.  This time we will randomly choose <em>one </em> of
the other subject's eight decisions to carry out.  The other
subject will get the points in the `hold' portion of the
decision, and you will get the points in the `pass' portion.
Your ``earnings'' will equal the total points from these two
pairings.
<p>
In the following section are the 8 choices we would like you to
make.  Please fill out the form, taking the time you need to be
accurate, and then submit your decisions.
<p>
<strong>
Thank you very much.  Good luck!
