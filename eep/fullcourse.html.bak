<title>  Experiments with Economic Principles: Sole Text </title> 
<hr>
<h1> Using the Book as a Sole Text </h1>

<hr>

Along with using the text as a supplement to enliven and enhance
a traditional "fat" book course, we have had great success basing
a course soley on the book.  In fact, here is 
<a href="../teaching/syll110.html"> Miller's syllabus </a>
from such a course.  Here is the <a href="../teaching/88110schedule.html">
time schedule </a> for this course.  With the exception of a few initial
classes designed for administrative details, some overview lectures, and one
class devoted to the process of developing theories from observations, the 
course is based on a three class rhythm (see below).
<p>
The above course meets three days a week (50 minutes each meeting).
The typical format I use is: 
<ul>
<li>
[Class Session 1]: run the experiment; 
<li>
[Class Session 2]: lab reports due and discussion (with references
to lab report); and
<li>
[Class Session 3]: homework due, complete discussion (with 
references to homework), and
provide broader implications and other applications of the theory.
</ul>
<p>
This general format scales up to large classes nicely if you 
allow your recitation sections to handle Class Session 1 
(the experiment).  

<p>
For classes that meet two days a week (1:15 minutes each meeting),
I use:
<ul>
<li> 
[Class Session 1]: homework due from previous experiment,
finalize discussion from previous experiment,
run the current experiment; and
<li>  
[Class Session 2]: lab report due, discussion (with references
to lab report), and
provide broader implications and other applications of the theory.
</ul>
