"This book is superb in conveying the excitement of learning
economic principles by doing. Students actually experience the
incentive effects of markets organized under different institutional
rules and the exercises provide a bridge from this experience to
basic principles of theory. This approach to education is inspiring
for teacher as well as student because each experiment is a discovery
for both."
<p>
Vernon Smith, University of Arizona

"I agree with the authors that principles can be taught more
memorably, enjoyably, and successfully by using experiments, rather
than in the conventional lecture format...a really revolutionary
change in the way economics is introduced."
<p> 
Alvin E. Roth, University of Pittsburgh

"Bergstrom and Miller have taken a refreshing approach to
combatting what is not only a problem I face each semester but that of
every teaching economist.  I have observed many instructors struggling and
looking for ways to get students' hands "dirty" so that they can
get a better feel for what this discipline is all about...
You would never expect for a moment that a technical education
teacher could teach his students the rudiments of being a mechanic without
once lifting the hood.  This book provides students with the "under-the-hood"
experience that they so badly need."

"The key to using experiments effectively is not just well designed
experiments, but the right follow-up material to draw out the key points/lessons in
the exercises.  This book is very good at this throughout..."
<p> 
John Kagel, University of Pittsburgh

"The authors have accomplished something rather
interesting and valuable: to educate and motivate a curiosity and interest
in economics via their experiments and to teach a considerable amount of
theory along the way.  In doing so they tap into the natural curiosities
of bright people interested in economics, or just interested in academically
oriented pursuits, in general.
Their book would inspire even the most skeptical student that there are many many interesting
applications and situations where economic principles are valuable to our
understanding and predictions about the world."

"An economics class based entirely upon lecture is about as stimulating
as an astronomy lecture in which you don't get to look through a telescope."
<p> 
Mark Isaac, University of Arizona

"I hate principals because they make you do stuff."
