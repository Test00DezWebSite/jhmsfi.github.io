Hi everyone! I found this on a bulletin<br>board and decided to try it:<p>A little while back, I was browsing through<br>newsgroups, just like you are now, and came<br>across an article similar to this that said<br>you could make thousands of dollars within<br>weeks with only an initial investment of<br>$6.00! <p>So I thought, "Yeah right, this must be a<br>scam", but like most of us, I was<br>curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said<br>that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names<br>and<br>address stated in the article. You then place<br>your own name and address in the bottom of<br>the list at #6, and post the article in at<br>least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands)<br>No catch, that was it. <p>So after thinking it over, and talking to a<br>few people first, I thought<br>about trying it. I figured: "what have I got<br>to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right?"<br>Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well<br>GUESSWHAT!?... within 7 days, I started<br>getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I<br>figured it would end soon, but the money just<br>kept coming in. In my first week, I made<br>about $25.00. <p>By the end of the second week I had made a<br>total of over $1,000.00! In the<br>third week I had over $10,000.00 and it's<br>still growing. This is now my fourth week and<br>I have made a total of just over $42,000.00<br>and it's still coming in rapidly. It's<br>certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have<br>spent more than that on the lottery!! <p>Let me tell you how this works and most<br>importantly, WHY it works... Also, make sure<br>you print a copy of this article NOW, so you<br>can get the information off of it as you need<br>it. I promise you that if you follow the<br>directions exactly, that you will start<br>making<br>more money than you thought possible by doing<br>something so easy! <p>Suggestion: Read this entire message<br>carefully! (print it out or download<br>it.)Follow the simple directions and watch<br>the money come in! It's easy. It's legal.<br>And,<br>your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)<br>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not<br>indecent; it is not illegal; and it is 99% no<br>risk - it really works! <p>If all of the following instructions are<br>adhered to, you will receive extraordinary<br>dividends. PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these<br>directions EXACTLY,<br>and$50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60<br>days. This program remains successful because<br>of the honesty and integrity of the<br>participants. Please continue its success by<br>carefully adhering to the instructions. You<br>will now become part of the Mail Order<br>business. In this business your product is<br>not solid and tangible, it's a service. You<br>are in the business of developing Mailing<br>Lists.<p>Many large corporations are happy to pay big<br>bucks for quality lists. However, the money<br>made from the mailing lists is secondary to<br>the income which is made from people like you<br>and me asking to be included in that list.<p>Here are the 4 easy steps to success: <br>STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and<br>write the following on each piece of paper<br>"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get<br>6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of<br>the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be<br>seen<br>through the envelope(to prevent thievery). <br>Next, place one paper in each of the 6<br>envelopes and seal them. You should now have<br>6<br>sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper<br>stating the above phrase, your name and<br>address, and a $1.00 bill. <p>What you are doing is creating a service.<br>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting<br>a<br>legitimate Service and you are paying for it!<br>Like most of us I was a little skeptical and<br>a little worried about the legal aspects of<br>it<br>all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post<br>Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed<br>that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes<br>to the following addresses: <p>#1) Suresh Seneviratne <br>834 SW 313th Court,<br>Federal Way, WA 98023<p>#2) R.Berry <br>31900 N.Marginal Rd. #211<br>Willowick, OH 44095<p>#3) L. Taylor<br>8245 N 27th Ave #2115<br>Phoenix, Az 85051<p>#4) C. Anglin<br>1625 W Hazelwood<br>Phoenix Az 85015<p>#5) W Ramsey<br>3201 Hillside Dr<br>Hattiesburg Ms 39401<p>#6) C. Mullins<br>10624 N 33rd Ave<br>Phoenix Az 85051<p>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list<br>that you see above, move the other names up<br>(6<br>becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR<br>Name as number 6 on the list. <p>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try<br>to keep this article as close to original as<br>possible. Now, post your amended article to<br>at<br>least 200<br>newsgroups. (I think there are close to<br>24,000 groups). All you need is 200, but<br>remember, the more you post, the more money<br>you make! You won't get very much unless you<br>post like crazy. :) This is perfectly legal! <p>If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18<br>Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws.<br>Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and,<br>whenever you<br>need money, you can use it again, and again.<br>PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains<br>successful because of the honesty and<br>integrity of the participants and by their<br>carefully adhering to the directions. Look at<br>it this way. If you are of integrity, the<br>program will continue and the money that so<br>many others have received will come your way.<p>NOTE: You may want to retain every name and<br>address sent to you, either on a computer or<br>hard copy and keep the notes people send you.<br>This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a<br>service. (Also, it might be a good idea to<br>wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the<br>risk of mail theft.) <p>So, as each post is downloaded and the<br>directions carefully followed, six members<br>will be reimbursed for their participation as<br>a List Developer with<br>one dollar each. Your name will move up the<br>list geometrically so that when your name<br>reaches the #1 position you will be receiving<br>thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an<br>opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of<br>the first six people listed above) <p>Send it now, add your own name to the list<br>and you're in business! ---DIRECTIONS -----<br>FOR HOW TO POST TONEWSGROUPS------------ <p>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this<br>entire letter to do your own posting. Simply<br>put your cursor at the beginning of this<br>letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of<br>this document, and select 'copy' from the<br>edit<br>menu. This will copy the entire letter in to<br>the computer's memory. <p>Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place<br>your cursor at the top of the blank page.<br>From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This<br>will<br>paste a copy of the letter into Note pad so<br>that you can add your name to the list. <p>Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt<br>file. If you want to do your postings in<br>different settings, you'll always have this<br>file to go back to.<p>Step 4) Use Netscape, Internet Explorer, or<br>Dog pile (search engine) and hunt down public<br>message boards, bulletin boards, chat rooms,<br>etc. It’s fun!!!!! <p>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post<br>this article as a new message by high<br>lighting<br>the text of this letter and selecting paste<br>from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this<br>will be the header that everyone sees as they<br>scroll through the list of postings in a<br>particular group, click the post message<br>button. You're done with your first one!<p>Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to<br>do is jump to different newsgroups and post<br>away, after you get the hang of it, it will<br>take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup!<br>**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST<br>IN,THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!

If you<br>wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name<br>to use, as long as the postman will deliver<br>it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE<br>CORRECT.**<p>Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent<br>me$1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each<br>with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond<br>to each of the original 5, that is another<br>$25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200<br>MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5<br>replies each, I will bring in an additional<br>$125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around<br>and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3<br>and only receive 5 replies each, I will make<br>an additional $625.00! <p>OK, now here is the fun part, each of those<br>625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with<br>my<br>name at #2 and They each only receive 5<br>replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those<br>3,125 persons will all deliver this message<br>to<br>200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if<br>still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I<br>will receive $15,625,00!<p>With an original investment of only $6.00!<br>AMAZING!
