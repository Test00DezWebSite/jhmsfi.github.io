This quarter, my colleague Steve Trejo at UCSB is using four experiments from our book in his class of about 500 students.  He lectures twice a week to the whole class and he has teaching assistants who meet once a week with groups of 40 students.  He has the t.a.'s run the experiments in the section meetings. <br>  For this class, McGraw-Hill ran off a custom printing version of the text that includes only the four experiments he is using and that costs students about $14.  They stand ready to do this for any <br>reasonably large class. (I don't know what is the lower bound).  Our experience was that ordering the<br>custom-printed version was hassle-free. We just talked to the local McGraw-Hill rep, got a couple of e-mail messages from McGraw's custom printers, and they sent us an ISBN number to order at the bookstores.<p>Trejo, his t.a.'s and his students seem very pleased with this experiment.  In fact, Trejo has decided that the next time he teaches introductory economics he wants to use the complete version of EEP and run nearly all of the experiments in  it.<p>
