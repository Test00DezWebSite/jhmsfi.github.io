: Principle1 : In a world of scarcity, every choice is 
: tradeoff.Almost all resources can be used many different 
: ways. In the end, howeverthey will usually be put to only 
: one use. Therefore, the decision to use a resource in a 
: particular way means that we have also chosen not to use 
: it in all other ways. Ask students what they give up to 
: attend a class. What does a student consider when deciding 
: whether to skip class or attend?

: That is all i asked frem all you kind folks.
: Thanks.
