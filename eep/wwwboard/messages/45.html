I'm going to write my essay for the degree in economics about judo economics and judo strategy, a competitive behavior based on rapid movement to avoiding head-to-head, letting go attacks from stronger forces, using "leverages" to exploit the weight and strenght (dimension and financial dues) against the adversary.<p>I'd like <br>to have good material indicated, expecially if i can find it online,<br>to have your opinions and comments about judo strategy<br>to have some industrial cases indicated that i can investigate and analyse from this point of view<p>Thank you everybody
