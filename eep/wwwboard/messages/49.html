I feel that incentives have worked for me.  When I was in school I could care less about what happened in school. I never learned anything in any of my classes.  When my teachers, and eventually my school, started the incentives programs I didn't care.  I didn't think anything could save me.  I was flunking all my classes and there was definitely no hope.  Then my teachers urged me to participate in a "money box." A fancy name for a money incentive.  To my surprise I actually tried  harder to do good and understand what was going on. I tried harder to get the money.  Hey, what teenager doesn't want money.  My classes did this "money box" quite often, and to my surprise my grades went up.  I went D's and F's to B's and C's.  I actually made honor roll.  I had a lot more self-esteem and confidence that I could do things.  The incentives program significantly increased my academic achievement. I no longer had a "I can't" attitude, but I had a "I can" attitude.  I no longer would "hang" with the crowd that would get me in trouble.  I found new friends that helped me with my problems.  Friends that wouldn't just solve my problems with drugs and alcohol.  Friends that actually cared.  So what I am trying to say is incentives basically saved my life.  I have successfully finished high school and i am on my way to college.  I actually got a scholarship.  I believe that incentives are a very very good thing that could help many people learn and become successful in life.
