<title>  Experiments with Economic Principles: Possible Variations </title> 
<hr>
<h1> Some Possible Variations for the Experiments</h1>

<hr>

<p>
Here are a few modifications for some of the experiments.
These variations in 
the experimental procedures either allow smoother operation
or result in some additional interesting behavior.

<hr>
<p>
<h2> Part I:  Competitive Markets </h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<p>
<li> Experiment 1: Supply and Demand
<p>
<ul>
<li> If you want to lessen the demands on the students, only record
the data for the last round of each session and do not require them
to calculate standard deviations.  They should then be instructed to ignore
questions that reference the "first round" or standard deviation
in the lab report and home work.
</ul>
<p>

<li> Experiment 2: Shifting Supply and Demand
<p>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2> Part II: Market Intervention and Public Policy </h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<p>
<li> Experiment 3: Sales Taxes
<p>
<ul>
<li> Table H3.4, p 119: You may want the students to add a row for when
the tax rate is $0 (for completeness).
<p>
</ul>
<li> Experiment 4: Prohibition
<p>
<li> Experiment 5: Minimum Wages
<p>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2> Part III: Imperfect Markets </h2>
<hr>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Experiment 6: Externalities
<p>
<ul>
<li> The following modifications to the procedure described in the
Instructor's Manual will make Session 3 (Marketable Pollution Permits)
run more smoothly.  This session can be challenging, since it requires
equilibration in two interdependent markets (of course, this also presents an
opportunity for you to discuss the basic idea of general equilibrium).
<p>
<ul>
<li> Require that all transactions (both permits and ornaments) 
be <strong>immediately</strong> reported to, and posted by, the market manager.
<p>
<li> Allow pollution permits to be sold <strong> more than once</strong>, but
do not allow any person in the market to <strong>hold more than 
one permit at a time</strong>.  
Any time a sale
occurs, the new buyer should write his/her ID and the sales price on
the permit.  
<p>
You may want to modify the permits to look like the following:
<p>
<pre>
--------------------------------------------------------------
               ***POLLUTION PERMIT***
--------------------------------------------------------------

Original Owners's ID:________

Owner's ID:_________  Price Paid: _________

Owner's ID:_________  Price Paid: _________

Owner's ID:_________  Price Paid: _________

Owner's ID:_________  Price Paid: _________

Owner's ID:_________  Price Paid: _________

--------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, you can just tell the students to write any new owner's IDs
and prices, in order, on the back of the permits.
<p> 
When reporting the price of the permits in the data, just use the price
of the last sale.
<p>

<li> You should designate a small area of the room as the "Permit Pit,"
and require all trading of permits to occur in that area.
Again, all permit sales should be immediately reported
to, and posted by, the market manager.
<p>
<li> Encourage the students to first spend time in the permit market and
only then enter the ornament market.  
<p>
<li> Ornament sales will happen slowly, but make sure that the prices of the
first few ornaments are quickly reported and posted.
<p>
<li>  You should find that initially there is a lot of activity in the permit market,
and only a trickle of ornament sales.  This is a good pattern to encourage.
After this initial period, the markets tend to clear quickly.
<p>
<li> Try your best to make sure everyone knows the prices that are emerging
from the market (especially during the first few minutes).
<p>
</ul>

<li> Increasing the externality cost from $15 to $30 will make this
lab more interesting since it will result in the market without interference
having a negative total profit.  If you make this change, you need to also
make four other changes: (1) each person in the market pays $30/t, where 
t is the total number of participants (previously this was $15/t), 
(2) the tax rate in Session 2 needs
to be increased to $30 per transaction (previously it was $15), 
(3) the number of permits you 
issue in Session 3 should only be 2N, where N is the number of complete
12-packs you distribute (previously it was 3N), and (4) you should still
give the permits to types 5, 8, and 11, but there will be more of these
types than available permits so you may want to rotate which of these folks
get permits during each session.
<p>
</ul>
<li> Experiment 7: Monopolies and Cartels
<p>
<ul>
<li> Although the experiment works with the distribution procedure
described in the Instructor's Manual, you can make the outcome more
interesting (by having the monopolistic outcome have lower quantity
supplied and a dead-weight loss) if you make the following modifications:
<p>
Materials:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Make ordered <strong>six</strong>-packs of Personal Information Sheets of
Types A,B,C,D,E,E. (Note: Each six-pack contains two Type E sheets.)
Make enough six-packs so you have at least one sheet per potential student.
<p>
<li> Make <strong>six</strong> extra Type E sheets.
<p>
</ul>
Distribution Procedure:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Give one of the extra Type E sheets to the first student.
<p>
<li> Then, distribute as many <strong>complete</strong> six-packs of Personal 
Information Sheets as you can.  Give Type E sheets to the remaining Students.
</ul>
<p> 
As per the instructions, when you run the experiment and need to 
pick sellers, pick only one student of each type (A-E), resulting in five sellers.
<p>
If you follow this procedure, you will have the following buyer types in the sessions:
<p>
<pre>
      Sessions 1 and 2

Buyer Type            Number

High-Value ($21)      4N-2+K
Low-Value ($16)       2N -2
</pre>
<p>
where N is the number of complete six-packs distributed, and K is the number
of additional Type E sheets distributed (not counting the one that was given
to the first student).
<p>
<pre>
      Sessions 3 and 4

Buyer Type                     Number
High-Value Student ($21)       N-1
Low-Value Student ($16)        2N-2
High-Value Non-Student ($21)   3N-1+K
Low-Value Non-Student ($16)    0
</pre>
<p>
where N is the number of complete six-packs distributed, and K is the number
of additional Type E sheets distributed (not counting the one that was given
to the first student).
<p>
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2> Part IV: Firms and Technology </h2>
<hr>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Experiment 8: Entry and Exit
<p>
<li> Experiment 9: Measuring Productivity
<p>
<li> Experiment 10: Comparative Advantage
<p>
</ul>

<p>
<hr>
<h2> Part IV: Information, Auctions, and Bargaining </h2>
<hr>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Experiment 11: Adverse Selection
<p>
<ul>
<li> In Session 4, rather than having 1/2 good cars and 1/2 lemons, use
the same distribution that you had in Session 3 (1/3 good and 2/3 lemons)--in fact,
you may want to just keep the used-car owners the same in both Session 3 and 4
(and, to save time, just distribute the car quality tags to the owners 
when you assign them their car quality in Session 3).
Under this modified procedure, the demonstration of the value of full
information is much more dramatic, since under Session 3 only lemons will be sold,
while under Session 4 all cars will be sold (thus resulting in a much higher
total profits and market efficiency). If you use the old procedure, 
the comparison between
Session 2 (where, a likely outcome is all cars being sold) and Session 4 (with,
again, all cars being sold but at different prices) is much less interesting
as total profits are identical (even though the distribution of these profits
between buyers and sellers is different).
<p>
<li> Page 323: You may want to add the following question (especially if you
modify the distribution procedure in Session 4 as described above):  
In Session 3, the total
amount of net profit earned by used-car owners who sold their cars on the market 
was _____, the total amount earned by dealers was ____, and the total profit earned
by both was _______.  In Session 4, the total
amount of net profit earned by used-car owners who sold their cars on the market 
was _____, the total amount earned by dealers was ____, and the total profit earned
by both was _______.
<p>

</ul>
<li> Experiment 12: Auctions
<p>
<li> Experiment 13: Bargaining
<p>

</ul>
