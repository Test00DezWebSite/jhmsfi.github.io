<h1> Getting Customized Versions of the Text</h1>

<hr>

Some instructors may want to use only a few of the experiments (for example,
as supplements to intermediate microeconomics or business economics
courses).
If this is the case, it may be worthwhile for you to 
contact your
local McGraw Hill representative about the possibility of getting a customized publication of the book
with only these chapters.
