<H1>Applications of Economic Principles in the News (2nd Edition)</H1>

<hr>

The newspapers and news magazines are full of   
stories about economics.   This page includes  
stories involving real-world applications of the  
principles of economics that we studied with  
experiments.  Seeing the way that economic ideas  
appear in the news brings the theories to life.   
Learning even a little bit of economic theory  
helps to make the news more comprehensible and  
interesting.
