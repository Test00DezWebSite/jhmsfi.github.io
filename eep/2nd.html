<h1> Major Changes in the Second Edition</h1>

<ul> 

<li>
A new experiment on Network Externalities. In one session, students   
experience the onset of new communications technologies like e-mail and fax  
machines.  A second session is devoted to competition between competing  
standards and the emergence of a dominant seller like Microsoft.
 
<li>
Expanded discussion of essential economic concepts, including a new  
section devoted to summarizing these concepts.
 
<li>
Answers to warm-up and discussion exercise questions are included in each  
chapter.
 
<li>
A new format for the lab notes and homework that simplifies the amount of  
effort required by students and  makes grading easier for the professor.
 
<li>
Expanded discussion sections and a few fine-tuning modifications of the  
experiments.
 
<li>
Improved format for the experimental materials, and new "quick-start"  
guides for each experiment.
