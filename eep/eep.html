<h2> Preface </h2>

<p>
Taking a course in experimental economics is a little like going to
dinner at a cannibal's house.  Sometimes  you will be the diner,
sometimes you will be part of the dinner,  sometimes both.

<p> 
If you take a laboratory course in the physical sciences,  you get
to mix  smelly chemicals,  or monkey with pulleys, or dissect a frog,
but you are always the experimenter and never the subject of the
experiment.  In the market experiments conducted  in this class, you
and your classmates will be the <em> participants </em> 
in the markets
as well as the scientific <em> observers </em>  who try to understand the
results.

<p> 
It is hard to imagine that a chemist can  put herself in the place
of a hydrogen molecule.  A biologist who studies animal behavior is not
likely to know  what it feels like to be a duck.  You are more
fortunate.  You are studying the behavior and interactions of people in
economically interesting situations.   And as one of these interacting
economic agents, you will be able to experience the problems faced by
such an agent first hand. We suspect that you will  learn nearly as
much about economic principles  from your experience as a participant
as you will from your analysis as an observer.
