<title>  Experiments with Economic Principles: Related Articles</title> 
<hr>
<h1> Articles Related to Various Chapters</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The newspapers are full of stories about economics. 
Here we include stories that are closely related
to ideas presented in our experiments.
Seeing applications of economic ideas in the news brings the
theories to life, and learning even a little bit of economic theory 
helps to make the news more comprehensible and interesting. 
<p>

Some of the entries are summaries of news stories that we have read. We also
link to some items selected from the Wall Street Journal and 
annotated by Professor Jan Gerson of the University of
Michigan as part of a project that is jointly sponsored by the WSJ 
and the textbook publisher WW Norton.
