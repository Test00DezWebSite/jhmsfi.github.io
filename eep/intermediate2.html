<h1> Using Experiments with Economic Principles: Microeconomics, 2nd Edition to Supplement Intermediate Courses</h1>

<hr>

<p> The book works well as a supplement to an intermediate course in
economic theory.  Below are some suggested chapters.  (See the
<a href="anntoc2.html"> annotated table of contents</a> for additional
descriptions of the experiments.)
<p> 
<hr> 
<h2> Part I:  Competitive Markets </h2> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 1: Supply and Demand</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd>This is a good way to
begin the class and get the students thinking about how markets work.
It teaches students to draw and understand step-function demand and
supply curves, and it  gives  them useful practice for later, more
elaborate experiments.  
</dl> 
<p>

<li> <strong> Experiment 2: Shifting Supply and Demand</strong> 
<dl>
<dd> The experiment and lab report can easily be skipped for
an intermediate class, although
assigning the discussion section and corresponding parts of the appendix may be a good idea.
</dl> 
</ul> 

<p> 
<hr> 
<h2> Part II: Market Intervention and Public Policy </h2> 

<ul> These three experiments are easy to do and fun for
the students.  You may want to pick one to accompany the appropriate
material.  
<p> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 3: Sales Taxes</strong> 
<dl>
<dd> Finally, they will figure out those shifts!  Students get to
explore the implications of putting a tax on the buyers versus the
sellers.   Skeptics are finally convinced of the equivalence of a tax
collected from demanders to a tax collected from suppliers.  Students
also learn first-hand the meaning of "excess burden" of taxation.
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 4: Prohibition</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> Students seem to really enjoy this experiment, perhaps because of the
topic.  Fundamentally, it is a nice application of some basic
competitive equilibrium theory.  
</dl> 
<p> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 5: Minimum Wages</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> In addition to learning about the
effects of market controls like price ceilings and floors, students learn
to define and measure voluntary and involuntary unemployment. 
</dl> 
<p>
</ul>

<p> 
<hr> 
<h2> Part III: Imperfect Markets </h2> 

<ul> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 6: Externalities</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> This experiment has been
very successful in intermediate classes.  The effect of externalities
is brought home in a dramatic (and frustratingly real) way to most students.
One session applies a Pigovian tax whose revenue is returned in equal
shares to all participants. The fact that a tax increases rather than
decreases total profits is a nice complement to the lesson on the
excess burden of a sales tax when there is no externality.  The final
session has two simultaneous markets, one for pollution permits, which
are present in fixed supply, and one for pollution-producing goods.
</dl> 
<p> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 7: Monopolies and Cartels</strong>
<dl> 
<dd> Students learn about monopoly pricing, price discrimination,
and how cartels can break down.  Students particularly enjoy watching
the cartels break apart, and this can lead to lively  discussions of
free riding behavior.  
</dl> 
</ul>

<p> 
<hr> 
<h2> Part IV: Firms and Technology </h2> 
<ul> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 8: Entry and Exit </strong> 
<dl> 
<dd>  This experiment has a two-stage game in which there is 
an "entry stage" and "market stage."  In the entry stage, firms
sequentially and publicly announce their intentions to enter or not
enter a local restaurant  industry.  Firms who enter  must pay a fixed
cost regardless of the number of meals they sell.  Each has constant
marginal cost and a fixed capacity.  In the market stage, firms sell
meals to consumers. If the number of entrants is "too
small" there will be profits, attracting more entrants in the next
round. If the number of entrants is "too large" there are losses, and
in  later rounds there are likely to be fewer entrants.
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 9: Network Externalities</strong>
<dl> 
<dd>This is a wonderful experiment to show the power of e-conomics to your
intermediate students.  This experiment discusses network externalities and some nice
theory as well.  The material is well suited for intermediate students,
and will show them how economics can be applied to the information age.
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 10: Measuring Productivity</strong>
<dl> 
<dd>More suitable for principles courses.  
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 11: Comparative Advantage</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd>Probably more suitable for principles courses.  
</dl> 
<p> 

</ul>

<p> 

<hr> 

<h2> Part IV: Information, Auctions, and Bargaining </h2> 

<ul> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 12: Adverse Selection</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> This experiment is based on George Akerlof's "Lemons" model.   
It works very well to bring the ideas of asymmetric information,  separating
equilibrium, pooling equilibrium, and self-confirming beliefs to life
for intermediate economics students.  
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 13: Auctions</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> Auction theory is a lovely
intermediate topic.  The experiment will get you started in the right
direction.  
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 14: Bargaining</strong>
<dl> 
<dd> A good way to begin discussions of game theory.   You can do
bargaining, and then add other interesting games (for example,
centipede games, etc.).  
</dl> 
<p> 
</ul>

<h2> Appendix: Further Economic Principles </h2> 
<ul>
All of this material is well suited to intermediate students.
