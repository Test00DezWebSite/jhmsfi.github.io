<h1> The Instructor's Manual for Experiments with Economic Principles: Microeconomics, 2nd Edition</h1>

<hr>

Instructors who are considering adopting the book should obtain a copy of the
Instructor's Manual from the publisher.  Many users have told us that any 
lingering worries about using this approach are alleviated upon reading
this manual.
<p>
The Instructor's Manual includes:

<ul>
<li> General hints on how to get the most from the experiments.
<li> Learning objectives for each experiment.
<li> Very detailed instructions on how to conduct each experiment.
<li> A "Quick-Start" that includes:
<ul>
<li> Simple capsule instructions for each experiment (take these with
you to class).
<li> Tables to simplify data collection during class.
<li> Original copies of all necessary experimental materials 
(Personal Information Sheets, Sales Contracts, etc.) for photocopying.
</ul>
<li> Reports on the outcomes of previously conducted experiments (these
will give you a very good idea of what to expect during a real experiment).
<li> And more....

</ul>
<p>
The Instructor's Manual is available from McGraw Hill (ISBN 0077 229519 8).
You should definitely get a copy if you are going to use the book.  Also,
make sure you keep up with the latest 
<a href="corrections2.html"> corrections </a> and 
<a href="variations2.html"> experimental variations</a>.


<p>
The Instructor's Manual is also available as a 
<a href="http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/eep/manmaker2.pdf">
PDF file</a> (1.7Mbytes).
(A note to students: We realize that instructor's manuals hold a 
certain amount of intrigue for some students.
Alas, this manual doesn't contain any test questions, 
easy answers to your homework, etc., but rather
good discussions of the mechanics behind how to conduct 
the experiments, and so forth.  Students are welcome to
read this document as you may learn a few subtleties
about the material in the different chapters.  However,
the easiest way for you to understand the material and do well on your
homework is to focus your time and effort towards the chapters
contained in the student version of the book.)

<p>
In the Instructor's Manual you will find all of the materials you
need to copy and handout to the students for each experiment.  
We have collected all of these
materials and placed them in a PostScript file of 
<a href="handouts.ps">distribution materials</a> or a
<a href="handouts.pdf">
PDF file</a>.  (You will still
want the Instructor's Manual for the Capsule Instructions and Data
Collection Tables.)
