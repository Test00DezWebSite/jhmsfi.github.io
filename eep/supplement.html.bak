<title>  Experiments with Economic Principles: Sole Text </title> 
<hr>
<h1> Using the Book as a Supplement </h1>

<hr>

While there is always a desire to improve the teaching of  
economic principles, it is remarkable how few real changes have been
incorporated into such classes over  
the past few generations.  As teachers we want to arouse the innate  
curiosity of our students about economic events, so that  with their awakened  
interest they can develop 
a long-lasting and deep understanding of economic ideas.  

<p>
While basing an entire course around experiments is an  
effective way to teach students the principles of economics, such a course may  
be a large step for many institutions.   An attractive alternative,  
on a smaller scale, is to incorporate a few of our experiments  
into a traditional lecture format course.  
The modular structure of the experiments allows instructors to
easily pick and choose topics that will highlight important lecture
material.  

<p>
Although the experiments in the book are designed for class sizes of 60 or
less, we have a number of ways for
<href="large.html"> running experiments in large classes</a>.
In the long term, such experiments could be
incorporated into the curriculum  
for large introductory courses by follwing the
model used in introductory courses in   the physical and
biological sciences, and running separate  laboratory courses  
in which a series of experiments are conducted over the term.   
(In fact, if you think back to your own experience in these types of
courses, it is likely that the laboratory sessions provide some of 
your most vivid memories.)
The pace of these laboratory courses may be more or less  
tied to that of the regular introductory courses,  
depending on the tastes of the instructors.
