<title>  Experiments with Economic Principles: A Note to Teachers </title>

<h1> A Note to Teachers </h1>

<hr>

We got tired of it.   Lecturing to sleepy students who want to  ``go
over''   material that they have already highlighted in their textbooks
so that they can remember the ``key ideas'' until the midterm.   We
wanted to engage our students in <em>active learning</em>, to exploit
their natural  curiosity about economic affairs, and  to  get them to
ponder the questions  before we try to give them  answers.  We  found
that conducting experiments in class, with discussions before,
during, and after the experiments is an effective and enjoyable way of
moving from passive learning to active learning.  <cite> Experiments with
Economic Principles</cite> is the result of these efforts.

<p>
This book is intended for students who have not taken any previous
economics courses (although, even those who have had some training
seem to enjoy and benefit from the experiments).  
It can be  used either as the main text  in an
introductory course or as a supplement to a traditional  principles
textbook.  The book  alternates   ``experimental chapters''  and
``discussion chapters.''     The  alternation between experiment and
discussion sets the   rhythm of the class.  In the lab, students
participate and  experience  a type of market or social interaction.
As they complete their lab reports, they organize their thoughts about
what happened. At the next class  meeting they are ready to  discuss
the experimental results  and  to consider theoretical explanations for
these results.

<p>
The experimental chapters typically  include an introduction,
instructions for a classroom experiment, and  a ``lab report.''   The
classroom experiments are conducted ``by hand,'' without the use of
computers or elaborate apparatus.   In the lab report, students record
the results,  perform elementary data analysis, and  answer questions
that encourage them to speculate on the significance of what  they have
observed.  The discussion chapters  introduce   economic theories that
partially explain the experimental results.  The discussion chapters
also include   homework assignments in which students are asked to
compare  experimental results with  theoretical predictions and to
explore the implications of the theories for real-world problems.

<p>
These  experiment-discussion modules are designed to be sufficiently
independent from each other that instructors can  rearrange the order of
presentation topics  or can omit topics  as desired.
