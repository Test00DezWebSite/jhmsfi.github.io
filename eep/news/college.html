<h2>The New Economics of Higher Education</h2>

<h5>By PETER PASSELL</h5>
<p>   
<p>   NEW ORLEANS  --  "I loved Tulane," recalled Hillery Martin, a
freshman from Los Angeles, about her search for just the right
school, "But if I hadn't gotten the scholarship, I probably would
have gone to the College of William and Mary."
<p>   Those words are music to the ears of Richard Whiteside, Tulane's
dean of admissions, whose decision last year to offer smaller merit
scholarships to larger numbers of applicants sharply increased both
enrollment and tuition income without lowering the academic quality
of entering freshmen.
<p>   "Just because this isn't a business, doesn't mean you shouldn't
use good business principles" to meet the university's goals, he
said.
<p>   Ms. Martin's choice also pleased Thomas Williams, a consultant
to Tulane and president of the Denver-based National Center for
Enrollment Management, a for-profit research firm.
<p>   The young woman's $10,000 scholarship  --  in any other business it
would be called a discount  --  brought down the price of a year at
Tulane to $18,700, roughly that of William and Mary, a competitor
in the tier of schools just below the Ivies.
<p>   Yet even the discounted tuition she is paying more than covers
Tulane's cost of educating an extra freshman. "You need to charge
what your market will bear, while keeping a vigilant eye on
affordability," said Williams, whose company is one of a
burgeoning group advising colleges on how to get more bang from a
scholarship buck.
<p>   Structuring scholarships in much the way airlines devise
supersaver fares may seem out of place in the cloistered world of
academia. But it is apparently the way of the future, as parents
seek better value from their five- or six-figure investments in
four-year colleges, and as all but the most selective colleges are
forced to focus on the problem of attracting good students without
losing revenue.
<p>   There is nothing wrong with this reshuffle of the financial
deck, proponents say. On the contrary, they insist, everybody
gains. "Efficiency and equity are not necessarily in conflict,"
said James Scannell of the consulting firm of Scannell & Kurz in
Pittsford, N.Y.
<p>   Before the 1960s the modest store of scholarship aid available
was mostly doled out according to merit. But as the idea that every
high school graduate deserved a shot at college became a fixture of
American life, the focus shifted to need. Washington got into the
act, creating guidelines for aid and supplying a good chunk of the
money through grants, loans and work-study programs.
<p>   These days the difference between the cost of college and what
the typical student can afford to pay certainly has not diminished.
Nor has the amount of need-based aid flowing to low- and
middle-income students.
<p>   But in an era in which private education again seems a luxury,
tuition discounting is increasingly seen by college administrators
as a competitive tool for wooing high achievers  --  or, in many
cases, simply filling classrooms with high school graduates who pay
more in tuition than they add to operating costs.
<p>   Tulane's scholarship policy illustrates the way the rudimentary
science of financial-aid leverage  --  what economists call price
discrimination  --  is altering college-enrollment practices. Tulane
faces no immediate financial crisis. But by the early 1990s,
administrators were uncomfortably aware that rapidly rising tuition
costs were outstripping students' ability to pay.
<p>   The sticker price of a Tulane education rose 68 percent more
than the cost of living from 1984 to 1994, while Americans' average
income gained only 25 percent. To lure high-achieving students from
low-income and even middle-class families, the university was
forced to "spend" a disproportionate amount of its added revenue
on scholarships.
<p>   Across the decade, its total financial-aid budget, excluding
government sources, rose by 400 percent, to $44 million. And
despite the increased aid, Tulane's competitive position apparently
eroded: Rather than admit less qualified students, the school
allowed its undergraduate population to fall from 5,342 in 1991, to
4,830 in 1995.
<p>   Williams, the consultant, recommended that the university use
data from past years to analyze the admissions "yield"  --  the
percentage of accepted applicants who actually enrolled  --  for each
of Tulane's colleges  --  liberal arts, architecture and engineering  -- 
and for various categories like the students' academic standing in
high school, the size of merit scholarships offered to them and
their financial need.
<p>   The results from this simple exercise were striking. In 1995,
Tulane's entire merit-based scholarship budget was spent on 111
full-tuition scholarships. And the yield from those scholarships
was very high.
<p>   But relatively few applicants who just missed the cut for these
generous merit grants  --  and thus received no aid offer at all  -- 
came to Tulane. So last year Dean Whiteside reduced the number of
full-tuition scholarships from 111 to 50 and offered $10,000
discounts (a bit less than half of tuition) to 600 of the most
qualified applicants from the pool of 6,400 high school seniors
admitted.
<p>   More than half of the 600 enrolled. The loss of a handful of
elite students who turned down the $10,000 offer but might have
jumped at $20,000 was more than offset by the enrollment of larger
numbers of still excellent freshmen with combined SAT scores above
1,350. And while merit-aid outlays went up, so did total tuition
income because the class size swelled by 98 students.
<p>   That proved to be a worthwhile trade-off, since Tulane had
classrooms and dorms to spare. "All we had to do was add a few
class sections," Whiteside said.
<p>   Tulane's rejiggering of merit aid offended no one. The only
losers, the 61 students who got $10,000 scholarships rather than a
free ride, never knew who they were.
<p>   But more sophisticated forms of price discrimination are
controversial. Many colleges are pumping up aid to students
expressing interest in less sought-after departments and decreasing
help for those fighting to get into popular ones.
<p>   Since Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh has few peers in
the sciences, for example, it offers little merit-based aid to
budding computer specialists. By contrast, high-achieving
applicants in liberal arts are courted with hefty discounts.
<p>   Sandra Baum, an economist at Skidmore College in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., notes that some colleges are now routinely using
merit aid to adjust their male-female mix. Many more are using
merit aid to increase the enrollment of blacks and Hispanic people.
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, for example, sets aside
full-tuition scholarships for the cream of its minority applicants.
<p>   
<p>   As colleges delve more deeply into the art of calculating just
the right level of financial aid to woo students, they are
discovering that certain variables that have nothing to do with
need or academic ability can make a big difference.
<p>   The Wall Street Journal reported that Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore, for example, found that less money was needed to
entice applicants who had visited the campus. While Johns Hopkins
apparently never acted on the evidence, there are plenty of other
benchmarks that could prove useful in formulating aid policies that
achieve enrollment goals at minimal revenue loss.
<p>   An easy one is geography. In-state applicants are widely assumed
to be less sensitive to price than out-of-state applicants. That
creates an incentive to offer bigger discounts to out-of-staters  -- 
particularly those with access to high quality, low-tuition public
schools like the University of Michigan or the University of
California at Berkeley.
<p>   "Such price discrimination is the next step," Williams
suggested, "and it's almost inevitable."
<p>   But the aggressive use of price discrimination makes many
educators uneasy. Few colleges, for example, have thus far followed
Carnegie-Mellon's policy of encouraging applicants to shop for the
best price. "If you received a financial-aid package from us that
was not competitive with other offers, let us know," urged a
letter from the admissions office to some applicants.
<p>   And while Dean Whiteside at Tulane plainly glories in the rough
and tumble of competing with recruiters at other colleges  --  "I
want them to say the sucker down in New Orleans ate my lunch," he
said enthusiastically  --  he still worries that offering different
aid packages to students of equal merit and need would undermine
the egalitarian spirit of Tulane's campus.
<p>   The even thornier issue is whether the sophisticated use of
financial leverage will reduce the amount of aid available to needy
students.
<p>   Certainly the incentive is there. Even students with limited
financial resources may be willing to scrimp and borrow to go to
the school of their choice if the aid they are offered shrinks.
Thus, figuring out students' threshold of pain allows colleges to
squeeze a little extra money out of them.
<p>   If the incentive is there, so is the moral rationale. "From an
economist's point of view," wrote James Day, the president of
Hardwick-Day, a Minnesota consulting firm, price discrimination
produces the most value for the most people. Thus "a market in
which willingness to pay is the chief arbiter in enrollment
decisions benefits society as the ultimate source of equity."
<p>   The unanswered question is whether the imperative of the market
will increase or decrease access to expensive private colleges for
low- and middle-income students.
<p>   Gordon Winston, an economist at Williams College in
Williamstown., Mass., is pessimistic. While merit-aid programs at
Tulane and many other schools appear for now to have created
win-win opportunities, he argues that grinding competition for
high-achieving students from affluent families will eventually come
at the expense of the needy ones.
<p>   "The more of our general subsidy that is targeted to
high-income students," he said, "the less there will be for the
needy kids."
