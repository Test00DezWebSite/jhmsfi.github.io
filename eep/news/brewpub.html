  <H3>Amid Brewpub Binge, Sobering Tales</H3>
 <P>
This story begins by saying:
"Eager entrepreneurs are pouring into the booming  
brewpub business--and some have wound up with  
hangovers. <P>
It reports that brewpubs "can produce a glass of  
beer for less than 30 cents and sell it for up to  
$5. "
<P> It goes on to say that " The numbers don't  
add up quite so neatly for  Dave Richards,  
co-owner of Rio Bravo Brewpub, Inc."  Mr.  
Richards had a highly successful brewpub in  
Albuquerque N.M. and so he and his sister decided  
to open one in Santa Barbara, Calif, the next  
year.  According to the story, "In California  
though, business went flat." The cost of brewing  
equipment was 

$20,000 higher than expected,  so that the  
break-even point in Santa Barbara was sales of  
$2,000 per day.  Flooding early in the year  
chased away tourists and on many days the brewpub  
brought in as little as $700 per day. 

<P> According to the story,  190 new brewpubs  
opened in the U.S. in 1995. This was nearly as  
many as the total number that  had opened in the  
previous 3 years.  But, it says, dozens of others  
are closing and many others are struggling.
