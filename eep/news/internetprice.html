<h2>Put Some Tollbooths Along the Information  
Highway</h2>

The Internet, once a sleepy pathway for  
academic researchers,
now hums with the traffic of some 20 million  
commercial, recreational and academic users. 
But likening the Internet to a superhighway  
disguises an important feature.  Highway drivers
have one vehicle apiece, so each takes up about  
the same amount of space.  On the Internet,
one person's traffic can take up a lot more space  
than another's.<p>

You can now make telephone calls, conduct  
videoconferences, listen to the radio and
browse the multimedia World Wide Web over the  
Internet.  It's all quite amazing, and it all
consumes much more capacity than the traditional  
uses of the Internet, such as sending files
or e-mail.<p>

For instance, while most people send e-mail  
messages on the Internet, some prefer to
"reach out and touch someone," using the new  
Internet Phone service, which allows them to
make very cheap calls anywhere in the world.  But  
a one-minute Internet call uses 500 times
the capacity of a comparable paragraph of e-mail.   
And one minute of video covering that
same paragraph uses 15,000 times as much  
capacity, the equivalent of sending more than
10,000 pages of text.<p>

     Can the Internet bear the strain of this  
high-intensity traffic?  Information travels the
Internet first-come, first served, so congestion  
from the new high-intensity uses already delays
and interrupts other people.  What will it be  
like in the future, as more people discover the
exciting new uses?<p>

     Optimists believe we can keep ahead of  
congestion by simply adding more computers
and lines to handle the traffic.  While a popular  
solution to Internet congestion in the past,
simply adding capacity won't work any more, for  
three reasons.  First, with the government
phasing out its Internet subsidies, we have fewer  
funds for expansion.  Second, while the
computers and lines that carry Internet traffic  
get cheaper to buy each year, they don't get
cheap enough so that the Internet can grow faster  
that its traffic, which is doubling every
year.<p>     

     Finally, we have the new high-intensity uses  
waiting in the wings to soak up any extra
capacity as soon as we add it.  We also have a  
propensity to invent more 
such uses.<p>

     Extra money alone won't solve the problem of  
Internet congestion.  But we do need to
expand, and in the absence of government  
subsidies, that requires generating more revenue. 
Most Internet users (or more typically, their  
employers) currently pay a fee that doesn't
depend on their use.  They are free to create as  
much traffic as they like, without regard to
the congestion it causes.  We should raise  
revenue for expansion in a way that makes the
heavy users aware of the congestion they  
cause.<p>

     At the same time, we should not discourage  
people from doing things that put little
load on the Internet, such as sending e-mail.<p>

     The old first-come, first-served rule no  
longer works. Instead, we should prioritize
Internet traffic according to the value users  
place on speedy delivery.  Want extra speed for a
message?  You should make a voluntary payment to  
increase your priority.  If you were
willing to wait a second or two, you would pay  
nothing.<p>

     Frustrated Internet users could then do  
something about congestion.  Now, for
example, when an Internet Phone call gets garbled  
because of congestion, the only option is
to wait until later to try again.  But if callers  
could pay to increase their priority, then they
could continue their conversation.<p>

     Audio and video don't work well if delayed,  
so those who want to use them are also
more likely to want increased priority.  But  
e-mailers, or others who don't mind a brief wait,
can continue using the Internet without making  
priority payments.  Those who put little
burden on the system need pay nothing, whereas  
the high-intensity users who cause
congestion would have an incentive to pay.<p>

     Allowing people to pay to overcome the  
effects of congestion would raise revenue for
expansion, and at the same time make the Internet  
a reliable resource.  For instance, a doctor
who makes a priority payment could confidently  
use video to treat patients remotely.  On the
other hand, a college student unwilling to pay  
for the priority necessary to send a video to his
sweetheart may settle for e-mail.<p>

     It would be a shame if we let traffic on the  
Internet slow to a crawl.  Instead, we
should take action to make sure the Internet  
realizes its potential as our information
superhighway.<p>
