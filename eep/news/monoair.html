<H1>A Price-Fixing Attempt</H1>
<P>
A  Wall Street Journal Story titled "Branson  
Starts Aerial War by Embarrassing Crandall"  
reports that "The battle over American Airlines  
proposed alliance with British Airways took an  
ugly turn yesterday, when the phone call that may  
forever haunt Robert Crandall, American's  
chairman and chief executive, surfaced publicly  
once again."
<P>
According to the story, Mr. Branson took out a  
series of ads that reprinted a transcript  made  
by the U.S. Justice Department of a 1982   
conversation in which Mr. Crandall is reported as  
saying to the president of the now-defunct  
Braniff International Airlines:  "Raise your  
g----- fares 20%. I'll raise mine the next  
morning.  You'll make more money and I will too."
<P> The WSJ reports that this  conversation came  
from a phone call that was secretly tape-recorded  
by Mr. Crandall's attorney and turned over to the  
Justice Department, which subsequently filed a  
price-fixing conspiracy charge against Mr.  
Crandall. 
<p>
According to the WSJ story, an American Airlines  
executive is quoted as saying that Mr. Crandall  
is "terribly sad about this dirty trick by  
Branson".  

<p>

The story does not report Mr. Crandall's feelings  
about his former attorney.
