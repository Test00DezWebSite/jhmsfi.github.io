<H4> Based on a  story in the <I>New York  
Times</I>,  December 25, 1996 </H4>

  <H3>Orange and Grapefruit Crop Should Set  
Record in Florida </H3>

<H4> Recovery from a Devastating Freeze is  
here, But Growers are not Ecstatic</H4> 

 <P>   The story reports that: "Seven years  
after a two-day freeze over the Christmas  
weekend devastated the Florida citrus crop,  
growers in the state are expecting their  
biggest crop ever, in large part because  
trees planted after that freeze are maturing  
and bearing fruit."

<P>  The story reports that in 1990 there  
were 79 million citrus trees in Florida, but  
in 1996 there are about 107 million.   
Typically, the trees take about 3 years to  
bear fruit and about 15 years to mature  
fully.
<P>

According to the story, the Florida  
Department of Citrus is predicting that the  
crop will be more than 10.4 million tons of  
oranges, compared with 9.6 million tons last  
year.  There will also be  about 2.7 million  
tons of grapefruit this year.  (The amount  
of grapefruit last year was not recorded.)   
The estimated "value"  of the orange crop  
this year is expected to $825 million,  <I>  
down</I> from $941 million last year.  


<P>  The estimated value of the grapefruit  
crop is expected to increase to $131 million  
this year from $103 million last year.

<H3>Questions</H3>
<P>  By what percentage did the quantity of  
oranges produced increase?  

<P>By what percentage did the price of  
oranges produced decrease? (Use the  
information that you have about the value of  
the crop and the change in the size of the 
crop to calculate this.)

<P> The price elasticity of demand for a  
good is defined to be the percentage  
increase in output divided by the  
percentage increase in price as one moves  
along the demand curve.  If the only source  
of oranges available to the market were  
Florida, what would you estimate the price  
elasticity of demand to be?

<P>Can you think of reasons why this might  
be an overestimate of the elasticity of  
demand? (Hint: What if there are other  
sources of oranges?)
