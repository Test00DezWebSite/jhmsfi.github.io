This news story reports that:  

<P>  "[S]ince 1986, car travel has increased almost  
40 percent, while highway capacity has barely  
grown," and  "Gridlock costs Americans  
roughly the equivalent of $51 billion a year in  
lost wages and wasted fuel...the situation is  
only going to get worse." 
<p>
The author suggests  that a possible remedy is   
"peak-period pricing,"   which means  charging  
drivers for access to highways during  peak  
times.<P>  


<hr>
According to the story: 

<P>
 "This simple idea  (peak-load pricing)  isn't  
new. But it hasn't been adopted on a single  
public road because politicians know it would be  
career suicide to force Americans to pay for  
something they've long had for free. Instead,  
they embrace solutions that are more politically  
palatable than they are effective. They  
include:<P>
<B>Building more roads.</B> Sounds good. But  
additional roads inevitably produce what traffic  
expert Anthony Downs in his book <I>Stuck in  
Traffic</I> calls "triple convergence." More  
commuters come--from other roads, from mass  
transit and from new developments. Soon, the new  
roads are as crowded as the old. Los Angeles is a  
monument to this phenomenon.<P>
<B>Bolstering mass transit.</B> Even if Americans  
could learn to rely on buses and trains--and  
that's a huge <I>if</I>--workplaces are now so  
spread out in the suburbs that connecting all the  
dots with buses or other transports in affordable  
and convenient routes is nearly impossible. This  
makes perfect sense. Suburbs were designed with  
drivers in mind. If the number of mass-transit  
users miraculously doubled, they still would  
constitute only 10 percent of commuters.<P>
<B>Developing "smart cars" and highways.</B> The  
federal government is spending millions a year to  
develop an intelligent-vehicle highway system. It  
would involve a network of road sensors and  
computers that would feed traffic information to  
car TV screens, warning of trouble spots. Sounds  
impressive, in a Jetsons sort of way. But its  
limitations are obvious: Drivers will head for  
open roads, relocating but not reducing  
congestion.<P> 


The story proposes the " more drastic solution of  
putting a price on the rush-hour commute.  
Peak-period pricing would turn all major  
metropolitan arteries into toll roads, with  
prices high enough to keep traffic moving  
steadily. During slow times, tolls would be cut  
or eliminated. Tolls could be collected easily,  
thanks to new technology that lets sensors read  
signals from small transponders inside the car.  
Fees would be debited from prepaid accounts.  "

<P>
The story has two interesting snippets of data,  
one is a report on an operating toll road in  
California which uses peak-load pricing:
<hr>
<P>
"About a year ago, a 10-mile, four-lane, fully  
automated toll road (the nation's first) replaced  
the median on the 91 Freeway in Orange County  
(California), one of the busiest roads in the  
country. With a peak one-way toll of $2.50, the  
privately operated 91 Express Lanes are some of  
the most expensive 10 miles of road to travel in  
the United States. Yet they attract roughly  
30,000 cars a day and have produced some  
surprising results.<P>
 Rather than becoming "Lexus Lanes" for well-off  
commuters, as expected, express lanes are a  
mirror of the freeway as a whole, attracting  
drivers from all income brackets, according to  
surveys by the California Private Transportation  
Co., which built the $126 million road. For many  
working parents, a $2.50 toll is preferable to  
steep overtime charges for day care. The fast  
lanes also are popular with independent  
contractors and other workers who are paid by the  
job.  "

<hr>
The other bit of data reported in the story  is  
an estimate of the "number of hours lost per  
year" (presumably the average number of hours per  
commuter)  by drivers in  large U.S. cities, due  
to sitting in traffic in some of the nations  
congested cities.  The story includes the  
following table:
