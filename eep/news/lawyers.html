You
may have thought that the escalation auction in class, where your
instructor auctioned a $1 bill to the highest bidder, but made the top
two bidders pay for it was amusing, but contrived.  Could anything like
this ever happen in the real world? Listen up!  <hr>

<H3>Ever  Hear the One About the Lawyers and the Window Bars </H3>

<H4>How a $909 Dispute Generated $100,000 in Legal Fees</H4>

<P> The story began when New York passed a law requiring window bars
for apartments with children under 10.  The governing board of a co-op
housing unit  at 360 W. 36th Street , a converted zipper factory in
the garment district, voted to charge the equipment to those residents
who needed it, rather than to divide the costs among all residents.

<P> Alec and Suzi Diacou, who lived in a ninth floor loft with a small
child, were billed by the co-op for  $909, the cost of installing the
window bars. They refused to pay.  

<P> Under the ownership contract of
the co-op apartments,  if there was a dispute between the co-op and the
unit's owner, the loser would have to reimburse the winner's legal
fees.

<P> The co-op board asked its lawyers to look into the matter.  The
calendar of legal procedings recorded in the article is as follows:
<UL><LI>October, 1987--The co-op's lawyers  bill the co-op for $315.
<LI> June, 1988--After various failed attempts to reach an out-of-court
settlement, the co-op's lawyers billed the co-op for $1015. Although
this was more than the cost of the window bars, the co-op reasoned that
if the Diacou's were not forced to pay, this would set a costly example
for other residents to follow.  <LI>By November, 1988, the co-op's
lawyers had filed suit and the co-op's legal fees had reached $5504.
<LI> On  January 26, 1989,   New York Civil Court Judge Richard Lane
found that "logic and substantial justice," as well as the terms of the
lease required the Diacous to pay the $909.  By this time, the co-op's
legal bill for the case had reached almost $10,000.  <LI> The Diacous
responded with an appeal to a higher court.  <LI> By March, 1990, the
co-op's total legal bill had reached $19,328, and an appeals court
overruled Judge Lane's verdict, saying the cost of the window bars
should be shared among all apartment residents.  <LI>  The co-op
responded with an appeal to a still higher court.  By December 1990,
the co-op's total legal expenses were $43,099.  <LI> In February, 1991,
the higher court ruled in favor of the co-op.  <LI> The Diacou's did
not challenge the higher court's decision on the window bars.  BUT they
sued to prevent their being assessed with the co-op's legal fees.  <LI>
The legal fight over who was obliged to pay the co-op's legal fees
continued until June 1993, at which time the co-op's total legal fees
were $73,547.  At this point, the two sides agreed to an arrangement
whereby the Diacous would pay   $30,000  of the co-op's legal fees and
the co-op would pay the remaining $43,547.  <LI> In addition to owing
the co-op $30,000 for its legal fees, the Diacous have paid their own
lawyers $30,000 for handling the case, and of course owe the $909 for
the window bars.

<P> David Berkey, a lawyer for the co-op, is quoted as saying "I think
the expenditures here were appropriate and were kept pretty much to a
minimum." He said that his client is pleased with the outcome.  "Every
step of the way they had an idea of what was going on... There were no
surprises in this case." 

<P> YES,  FOLKS,  He really said that.  

<P>
Mr. Diacou is quoted as saying  "I am a man converted.  Anything you
can possibly do to avoid a lawsuit, do it. "
