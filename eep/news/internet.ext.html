<IMG SRC="/images/b.gif" alt=B border=0 align=left width=33 height=34>andwidth has become the Holy Grail of the Internet, the 
unspoken contingency clause upon which virtually all 
software developers and most content developers are 
mortgaging their future.
<p>Video conferencing? Videophones? Net phones? Movies 
on demand? Voice e-mail? Virtual Reality? Each of these 
gizmos and many others already exist in some form, ready 
to run on both the server to which you're connected and the 
PC on your desk or lap.
<p>But the pipes between your computer and whatever data 
you're trying to get from the Internet are invariably 
clogged. So while investors line up to wager
 millions of dollars into the next exotic Internet 
technology, you sit waiting on line like some high-tech 
peasant in a 10 kilometer bread queue.
<p>How, you wonder, are we going to add all the wonders you 
keep hearing about -- the Java applets, the real-time video 
and audio, the Shockwave animation and sundry other 
fancy technologies -- if we're already stalled in bumper-to-
bumper traffic on the Information Superhighway? 

<p>When will they widen the highway and raise the speed 
limit?
<p>
<b><a name=they><font color=#000000 size=+1>There Is No "They"</font></b>
<p><img src="/images/t.gif" width=31 height=34 align=left alt=T>he answer is that there is no answer because with the 
Internet there is no "they" -- at least not in the sense that 
humans are accustomed to organizing societies, 
governments and cultural institutions. 
<p>Which is why more and more industry observers are 
voicing suspicions that the anarchy of the Internet may be 
its undoing.

<p><tr><td valign=top>Nowhere is this more evident than in the development of 
the Internet's so-called <b>backbones</b>, the super-high-speed 
pipelines in which all the packets of bits and bytes 
traveling between you and some remote server merge with 
packets being exchanged by millions of other users, some 
human, some robotic, all vying for a bigger, faster ride 
through the pipe.

But whereas you can petition government agencies or 
government-regulated utilities for a bigger sewer or water 
line or an expanded roadway, the owners and operators of 
the public portion of the Internet backbone are private 
businesses. And they are frankly perplexed about how 
they're going to make a return on the enormous investment 
it will take to widen the highway and unclog the pipes.
<p>In a recent interview, Robert Raisch, chief scientist of the 
Internet Company, a server host and developer, stated 
flatly, "There is no economic model to support the 
continued growth of high-bandwidth use on the global 
computer network."

<b>Backbone</b>:<br></font><font size=-1>
The high-speed fiber-optic cables which shuttle information through the internet
at 45 million to 155 million bits per second--more than 10,000 times faster than 
a 14.4 modem.

<hr size=1>
</font>
</ul>

<tr><td>

<p>And that, says Hal Varian, dean of the School of 
Information Management and Systems at the University of 
California, Berkeley, is the problem with the Internet: The 
lack of an economic rationale for raising the Internet's 
speed limit is a major cause of its latency -- at times 
outright gridlock -- and a gaping pothole smack in the 
middle of the road to the network's future.


<p>


Much of the Internet's backbone system consists of 
common information conduits, and the companies that 
manage them hesitate to spend money upgrading them, 
because the investment could benefit competitors who also 
make use of those conduits.  
<p>One result of that reluctance is that the Internet is 
becoming, in Raisch's words, "a thirsty garden."
<p>"Huge portions of the garden will wither, blacken and die 
for want of moisture," Raisch predicted. "The weather is 
turning, and there is a major drought on the horizon.  But is 
not for want of water itself.  We simply can't afford the 
hoses."  
<p><b><a name=NSF><font color=#000000 size=+1>From NSFNET to Commercial Control</font></b>

<p><img src="/images/t.gif" align=left width=31 height=34 alt=T>he backbones of today's Internet trace their history to the 
mid-1980s, when the National Science Foundation created 
the NSFNET. The idea was to make the foundation's five 
supercomputers available to scholars via the NSFNET 
information pipeline at the then-unbelievable speed of 
56,000 bits per second.   
<p>Yet increasing network traffic soon overwhelmed the 
servers and telephone lines of the NSFNET.  So in 1987, 
International Business Machines Corporation and MCI, in 
partnership with Merit Network Inc., the State of 
Michigan's educational network, upgraded the network's 
backbone to a T1 speed -- 1.5 million bits per second.  And 
in 1991, the foundation lifted the restrictions on the 
commercial use of the network and upgraded its backbone 
to a T3 speed, or 45 million bits per second.  
<p>Other networks, including Advanced Network & Services 
Inc. and the very-high-speed Backbone Network Service, 
or vBNS, evolved to handle the increased demand on the 
Internet and to test new technologies. 
<p>Advanced Network Services, originally a not-for-profit 
consortium of IBM, MCI, Northern Telecom and Merit, 
began in 1990 and was acquired by America Online in 
February 1995.  
<p>vBNS, which is sponsored by the National Science 
Foundation, returns the NSFNET to the old days of a 
closed-access research system linking the same five 
supercomputers: the Pittsburgh and San Diego 
Supercomputing Centers, the Cornell Theory Center, the 
National Center for Supercomputer Applications in 
Urbana, Ill., and the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research in Colorado.    
<p>Now the vBNS speed is OC-3, or 155 million bits per 
second, and it's projected to reach OC-12, 622 million bits 
per second, by early next year at the latest.  
<p>MCI is the vBNS provider and one of the major Internet 
backbone providers, along with Advanced Network & 
Services, Sprint, and MFS Data Services/UUNET.  
<p>


<tr><td valign=top>In addition to the lines themselves, the backbone system 
consists of huge hubs where all the intersecting high-speed 
lines merge to reroute billions of packets of data and send 
them on their way to their next stop -- either the Internet 
service provider from which they've been requested or, 
along a different line, to another hub for further routing.
<p>There are two kinds of hubs -- <b>Naps</b> (for Network Access 
Points) and <b>Maes</b> (for Metropolitan Area Exchanges). The 
only significant difference between them is their origins: 
Naps were officially chartered by the National Science 
Foundation when it turned the Internet over to the public 
sector in 1995.
<p>The Naps were assigned to Pacific Bell, Sprint, Ameritech 
and MFS Data Services/UUNET.  
<p>Maes, though not officially chartered, do the same work as 
Naps. MFS Data Services/UUNET operates about a dozen 
Maes and has announced plans to add more in the United 
States, Germany and France.

MCI is also investing heavily in public- and commercial-
access portions of the Internet backbone. It recently 
announced a joint venture with British Telecom that will 
boost total Internet capacity by 30 percent. The venture, 
dubbed Concert InternetPlus, will initially combine the two 
companies' existing backbone systems into eight new 
regional Internet superhubs, similar to Naps or Maes, to 
avoid having to route most traffic through the United 
States, said Allen Clark, a spokesman for MCI.

<p>"These will expand within the year to a total of 20 hubs in 
key locations around the world,"  Clark said.

<p>The free-market rules in the Telecommunications Act of 
1996 will be the ultimate arbiter of the future shape of the 
Internet's backbones.  For example, MFS Data 
Services/UUNET is now an Internet 
service provider, as well as the owner of both a Nap and is now an Internet 
Maes. Microsoft has a seat on its board.

it faces almost insatiable demand, as telephone companies, 
cable companies and Internet service providers all rush to

<p>And here lies the Catch-22 of bandwidth. The more users 
venture beyond 28.8 Kbps modems into high-speed 
connections, the more crowded the backbone becomes. So 
increasing your access speed at home or at the office 
contributes to the slowing down of the Internet as a whole.

For example, BellSouth, which has no investment in the 
Internet's backbone, is active in developing and 
implementing high-speed access schemes like 
Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Lines (or ADSL, capable 
of receiving data at up to 7 megabits per second over 
existing copper phone lines), cable modems (capable of 
receiving 10 megabits per second) and Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode (which guarantees needed bandwidth for 
streaming applications like real-time audio and video). 

<p>"We are preparing to soon move our development work in 
ADSL from the lab stage to trial stage," said BellSouth's 
spokesman, Ted Creech.   "We have also just introduced 
our cable modem-based trial of interactive and video 
services to some 8,000 customers in Chamblee, Ga., and 
our ISDN service has never been more popular."

Some observers are skeptical of such claims on the part of 
the telephone companies because, they note, emerging 
Internet phone technologies could grab a big chunk of the 
phone companies' existing business.

<p>"All of the telcos have fiber optic lines they have no idea 
how to sell -- without cannibalizing their existing 
business," said Raisch.

<p>Even so, all the telephone companies are talking the talk. 
Morgan Littlewood, director of Internet services marketing 
for Cisco, a leading supplier of networking technologies, 
said of the phone companies, "If the applications are there, 
such as electronic commerce, they will be interested" in 
high bandwidth service.

<p>It all boils down to how much improvement is profitable.  

<p>BellSouth's Creech said that providing high technology just 
for the sake of doing it wouldn't serve the company's 
customers or its stockholders in the long run. 

<p>

And Betty Jo Chang, director of technology programs for 
the Global Network Services Company of MFS Data 
Services/UUNET, observed, "A lot of telco folks got 
burned with video-on-demand games a couple years ago -- 
just like some are going to get burned by the Internet 
toaster game now."  

<p>UC-Berkeley's Varian agrees, adding that the Baby Bells 
are holding back on ISDN lines, for example, out of fear 
that they'll see their investment washed away by cable 
modems or some other developing technology. "They don't 
want to invest in an obsolete technology," Varian said. 
"And who can blame them?"  

<p><b><a name=bill><font color=#000000 size=+1>Toward a New Billing Model?</font>
</b>

<p><img src="/images/h.gif" height=33 width=34 align=left alt=H>owever things shake out on the client end of the Internet, 
MCI's Clark argues that free-market forces will ensure 
enough bandwidth at the backbone end to make the Internet 
viable.  

<p>"With more companies investing in Internet technology," 
he said, "market forces will drive the Internet industry to 
respond."  

<p>But the market also requires profits throughout the system. 
While competition among Internet service providers has 
whittled the price point for unlimited consumer access to 
about $20 a month, many observers argue that if bandwidth 
is ever to increase, the billing model itself must change.
<tr><td>
<p>There are now three basic billing models: 

<ul><li>Flat rate, in which a user pays a certain fee for 
unlimited access.
<p><li>Metered usage, in which the user pays by the amount 
of data sent or received.
<p><li>Timed charges, in which the user pays by the minute or 
other fraction of an hour.
</ul>

<p>There is a growing consensus that only metered billing can 
provide enough profits for service providers and backbone 
administrators to expand their bandwidth. In other words, 
you're probably going to be paying a lot more in the future 
for fancy real-time audio and video on the Net than you'll 
be paying to send and receive your e-mail.
<td valign=top width=200>

The <a href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley School of Information Management & Systems</a> web site includes 
a discussion of <a href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/resources/infoecon/Pricing.html">
Usage-Based Pricing Schemes</a>.
<hr size=1>

</ul>
</font>
<tr><td>
<p>Without metered pricing, the Internet service provider will 
suffer most, Raisch predicts. "They will need to raise prices 
to both consumer and server to support the required load," 
he said. "This is why I believe the mom-and-pop local ISP 
is doomed."  

<p>The industry may already be realizing Raisch's prediction.

<p>Mae east, operated by MFS Data Services/UUNET, is 
seeing an increase in high speed, giga-switch, connections 
and a decrease in slower, ethernet connections, says Chang. 
That, she says, is "indicative of the slow but sure 
shakedown into large national ISPs and smaller regional 
ISPs."  

<p>But some observers also see a silver lining in a metered 
plan set at a price point designed to guarantee plenty of 
bandwidth for multimedia applications.

<p>"If the Net is engineered to support real-time video, then 
everything else is essentially free," said Varian. "Just 
because you can reserve high-priority bandwidth doesn't 
mean that low-priority bandwidth can't remain very cheap.  

<p>"My guess is that we'll see a mixture of flat rate and 
metered pricing. The flat rate network will work fine for e-
mail and other slow traffic. Real-time communication will 
require metering."

<p>And when will this happen? That, Varian suggests, depends 
on how crowded the backbone gets in the near term.

<p>"We can probably live with a flat-rate network that looks 
like L.A. at rush hour," Varian said, "but not one that looks 
like Bangkok at rush hour."
