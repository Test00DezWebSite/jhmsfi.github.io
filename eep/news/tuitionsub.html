<TITLE>College Tuition Subsidies</TITLE>

  <H3>TAX BREAKS MAY RAISE TUITION</H3>
 <P>
This story discusses a proposed subsidy toward  
college tuition at colleges and universities.   
This tax break would take two forms: 

<UL>
<Li> A $1500 to $3800 exemption for tuition based  
on the family's tax bracket
<li> A $1500 credit for a student maintaining a   
B average during the first two years of college.
</ul>

According to this story:
 <P>
 "President Clinton's proposed tax breaks to help  
the middle class pay college tuition may result  
in little savings to families but a windfall to  
schools.  <P>

The story maintains that "Critics fear that  
universities will simply use this as an excuse to  
raise tuition - an assertion hotly disputed by  
University of Michigan provost J. Bernard Machen.   
<P>
Wayne E. Becraft, director of the American  
Association of College Registrars and Admissions  
Officers is quotes as saying: "Tuitions are going  
up fast already, but I expect them to go up even  
faster (if the proposals are enacted)... But  
colleges won't just increase tuition for the heck  
of it. Schools will have to adjust staff and  
facilities to meet the volumes that are expected  
from an influx of new students."
According to the story Provost Machen at the  
University of Michigan said that "except for  
inflation, tuition at the University of Michigan  
is about as high as it can possibly be," and  
therefore the proposed tuition subsidies would  
only benefit the students and not the university  
itself. 

 <P>
The story suggests that tuition is most likely to  
rise at community colleges, where Clinton's tax  
credit is $300 larger than the average tuition.   
As a result, the two-year schools are expected to  
raise tuition to match the full amount of the tax  
credit. 

 <P>
A White House spokesman, Barry Toiv,  is reported  
as saying, "But we hope that colleges will be  
responsible and not make this a problem or an  
incentive to raise tuition."  

<P>Robert McGee, a taxation and public policy  
professor at Seton Hall University, said the tax  
breaks would lessen the pressures on these  
schools to keep costs down.  The story reports  
that according to Mr. McGee,  "In the past,  when  
the government has helped with higher education  
expenses, colleges have raised tuition.
>From 1944 to 1947   the  college population  
doubled and tuition increased sharply when the  
government paid tuition for nearly 2 million  
officers in the GI bill."
<P>
"That not only benefited the students, but more  
the schools," said Judy Bellafaire, a historian  
with the U.S. Army. "Schools began to say, `Hey,  
if the government is going to pay for this, we're  
going to up tuition to the maximum'.  Colleges  
knew they had a good thing going."

<H3> Some Exercises  for You</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Draw supply and demand curves for college  
education and find the predicted effect on  
college enrollment and on tuition.
<LI> Show that Wayne E. Becroft's remark that 

"colleges won't just increase tuition for the  
heck of it. Schools will have to adjust staff and  
facilities to meet the volumes that are expected  
from an influx of new students."  would be  
consistent with an upward-sloping supply curve,  
but not with a horizontal supply curve.
<LI>If you can make any sense out of Provost  
Machen's remark in the same paragraph, please let  
us know. 
<LI> Explain why the community colleges are  
almost certain to raise their tuition to be at  
least as high as the subsidy.
<LI> Do you think that Barry Toiv's remark that   
"we hope that colleges will be responsible and  
not make this a problem or an incentive to raise  
tuition" 

is adequate reassurance that colleges won't raise  
their tuition by the full amount of the subsidy?   
Can you think of a more convincing argument for  
why they might not raise their tuition very much?  
(What would have to be true of the supply curve  
for this effect to be small?) 

<LI> Can you use supply and demand curves to  
explain the effects of the GI bill as reported by  
Robert McGee?
<LI> Do you think universities are going to say  
as, as Judy Bellafaire, suggests  , `Hey, if the  
government is going to pay for this, we're going  
to up tuition to the maximum'.  And what do you  
suppose Judy Bellafaire means by "the maximum"?   

<LI> Do you think that if students get a tuition  
subsidy of $1500 only if they maintain an average  
of B or better, there will be a decrease in the  
number of economics students (where grading is  
relatively strict) and an increase in the number  
of psychology and sociology students (where  
grading is easier)?
<LI>Please be aware that while economics can make sense  
of many things in the newspapers that seem  
mysterious to the uninitiated, a lot of stuff  
that people say in the newspapers (and elsewhere)  
probably doesn't make any sense at all.
