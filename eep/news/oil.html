<H1>Oil Producers Try to Control Industry Supply</H1>

<P>Below you will find a series of stories and tables relating a series
of events in the world oil market, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.
I will watch for new stories in the next few days. Eventually, I will add
a series of questions and exercises on supply and demand for economics
principles students.</P>

<H2>Big Petroleum Exporters Move to Stanch Oil Glut</H2>

<UL>
<P><B><I>WSJ, Monday, March 23, 1998 by Bhushan Bhuree 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></I></B>Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico moved to end
an oil glut and a period of cheap energy prices... </P>

<P>The three major oil producers said yesterday that they had agreed to
reduce their own oil production and seek cuts by others, such as Norway,
Russia, and Oman. Their goal: a supply reduction of as much as 2 million
barrels a day, or about 2.5% of the total world demand for oil of about
5 million barrels a day. </P>

<P>In a joint statement issued in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the oil ministers
of the three countries said that they had already received pledges of cuts
from other producers that added to their own reductions, amounted to 1.1
million barrels per day. </P>

<P>That is seen by industry experts as more than enough to trigger a sharp
turn around in oil markets, which have seen prices drop by as much as 40%
since OPEC members decided to raise their output ceiling by 10% or two
million barrels a day, in November... </P>

<P>Oil-futures prices bounced back at the end of last week amid talk that
producers were preparing to cut back supply. On Friday, crude oil for April
delivery rose to $14.32, up 12% from Tuesday's low of $12,80. (Tuesday's
price) represented a decline of more than 50% from prices in the winter
of 1996-97. </P>

<P>Sunday's accord surprised many in the industry who figured that OPEC
would need more time to agree to output cuts and that (OPEC) could expect
little help from other (non-OPEC) producers....</P>

<P>...During the oil-price crash of the mid-1980's, some non-OPEC countries
had promised, but never delivered, cuts in their output. </P>
</UL>

<H2>Non-OPEC&nbsp;Members Get Higher Profile</H2>

<UL>
<P><B><I>WSJ, March 24, 1998 by Peter Fritsch 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></I></B>The surprising agreement between the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large oil producers to cut oil
production may not be enough to trim the glut of world supplies. But the
pact does signal a new role for non-OPEC&nbsp;countries like Mexico.</P>

<P>The decision by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela--both OPEC&nbsp;members--and
Mexico over the weekend to trim output to push up low oil prices won some
support from other producers and sent oil prices soaring. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for May delivery jumped $1.90 to $16.51
per barrel.</P>

<P>Kuwait, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates--as expected--announced that
they too will cut output to shore up world prices, as did Oman, Algeria,
and Libya. </P>

<P>The participation of Mexico was key to the unusual decision, analysts
said. When oil prices collapsed in the mid 1980's, and again to a lesser
extent, in 1993, OPEC complained that non-OPEC producers failed to act
to underpin the market...</P>

<P>Still it remains to be seen whether the latest round of oil-production
cuts are enough. Because so many OPEC&nbsp;producers were exceeding their
quotas, the latest agreement brings the market back to its production levels
of last Thanksgiving when OPEC&nbsp;agreed to boost production by two million
barrels a day. But a mild winter and troubles in Asia also have weakened
oil demand. Longer term, new oil provinces in Central Asia, West Africa,
and Latin America promise to add to supply, and advances in oil technology
have made it economic to hunt for oil at lower oil prices. And one day,
Iraq will again be pumping several million barrels a day--at least.</P>

<P>[The story includes the following table showing current quotas of OPEC
members and actual outputs and output cuts promised by several countries.
All figures are quoted in barrels per day of output.]</P>

<H2>Cut in Oil Output May Prove Less Than Expected</H2>

<UL>
<P><B><I>WSJ, March 25, 1998 by Bhushan Bhuree</I></B>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>As OPEC's oil ministers plan a meeting early next week to endorse temporary
output reductions, some industry experts are already figuring the supply
cuts will prove to be far less than expected. </P>

<P>Major oil producers might reduce their output by only about half the
announced goal of two million barrels per day, or 2.6% of world output,
experts say, hampering OPEC's efforts to push crude-oil prices higher...</P>

<P>Yesterday, crude oil for May delivery fell 59 cents to $15.92 per barrel.,
a day after it rose $1.90 following the announcement of of supply cuts...</P>

<P>After adding up potential supply cuts, industry experts say the supply
reductions are likely to be in the range of 750,000 barrels a day to 1.1
million barrels a day...</P>

<P><B>[<I><TT>This story contains some other interesting  
tidbits</TT></I>.]</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Oil prices could shoot up higher if Norway, the world's second-largest
exporter after Saudi Arabia, agrees to reduce its output...Norway is still
considering how to proceed. </LI>

<LI>An oil-market expert said that Russia isn't likely to reduce its production.
He says that Russia in the past couldn't cut output when its industry was
controlled by one state entity and that they are even less likely to be
able to do so now with output decisions decentralized to many producing
associations. </LI>

<LI>(Oil-market experts) said that producers of heavy high-sulfur oil in
California and Canada and operators of low-volume stripper wells were on
the verge of closing down operations before the weekend announcement. Moreover,
major international oil companies were beginning to re-evaluate proposed
capital spending on oil-production projects in the light of low oil prices.</LI>
