Here is a website for anti-noise cranks.  It looks like a pretty good source  
for articles and news about pollution, but including the whole thing may be  
a bit overwhelming for students.

Below I give you a couple of reasonably interesting selections from this site.

_Mayor of Ohio Town Wants a New Noise Ordinance; Some Residents Oppose the Idea

_PUBLICATION: The Cincinnati Enquirer
DATE: July 23, 1997
SECTION: Metro, Pg. B03
BYLINE: Janet Wetzel
DATELINE: Deer Park, Ohio
ACTIVISTS, INDIVIDUALS, AND GROUPS MENTIONED: Francis Healy, Mayor

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that a new noise ordinance is being  
considered by the city council in Deer Park, Ohio to deal mostly with loud  
car stereos. The proposed ordinance has the support of the city's mayor, but  
is being opposed by at least two outspoken residents.

According to the article, Deer Park Mayor Francis Healy said the new  
ordinance is needed to control loud car stereos. He said, "I get a lot of  
complaints, particularly about loud boom boxes in cars," with some "playing  
so . . . loud you couldn't hear a fire engine if it pulled up beside you."  
The mayor added that the new ordinance would give police the power to tell  
drivers of such vehicles to turn down the volume. Critics say the city's  
disturbing the peace law covers the problem, but that law requires someone to  
sign a warrant. Many people are afraid to sign their name to a warrant, the  
mayor said, because they don't want the noise violator to find out they  
complained to the police. The proposed noise ordinance would not require a  
resident to sign a warrant.

The article goes on to report that at least two residents, Tom Callahan and  
Hermann Tegenkamp, are loudly opposing the proposed ordinance. According to  
Callahan and Tegenkamp, the proposed ordinance could lead to abuses by  
neighbors who could complain anonymously. In addition, Tegenkamp argues that  
the proposed ordinance would allow police to cite people who they believe are  
too noisy without a clear definition of what is too noisy. Both men agree  
that the language in the ordinance is too broad and too vague, prohibiting  
loud "human voice" and "plainly audible" audio emissions 50 feet away, with  
no decibel guideline. Callahan said he plays in a band that practices at his  
home, and although he's worked to be considerate of his neighbors, he's  
worried that the new ordinance could create problems. Tegenkamp added, "I've  
talked to a lot of people in Deer Park, and everyone I've talked to is  
against it. We have an ordinance that works. It's called 'disturbing the  
peace.' There's no need to have a new one."

The article says that Mayor Healy responded to the criticisms by saying  
"police are not going to to be out there picking on anyone," and citations  
likely would be infrequent. He added that noise ordinances are common, and  
that the cities of Cincinnati, Sharonville, and Springdale have them.

The article concludes that at a July 14 city council meeting, councillors  
turned down the mayor's request to pass the ordinance as an emergency  
measure, saying they wanted more input from residents. The mayor said he has  
heard no opposition to the ordinance except from Tegenkamp and Callahan, and  
hopes the council will pass it on August 11. The council voted down a similar  
proposed ordinance about five years ago after deciding the disturbing the  
peace law was adequate, said David O'Leary, safety service director.

_Maine Residents Complain About Personal Watercraft on Local Lakes

_PUBLICATION: Bangor Daily News
DATE: July 25, 1997
DATELINE: Cherryfield and Surry, Maine

The Bangor Daily News printed the following letter-to-the-editors from  
residents in Surry and Cherryfield, Maine regarding noise from personal  
watercraft on local lakes:

To the editor:

I am writing in response to the article of Monday, July 21 on the front page  
titled, "Case made for personal watercraft." I was quite dismayed at the  
lack of concern for the wildlife, and for the apparent lack on reporting one  
side of the controversial story. I have lived on a lake for over 10 years and  
have seen the different progression of technology and development of the  
personal watercraft. Maybe my story is one-sided, but true.

Let me tell you what I have seen. I have seen people towing skiers without a  
spotter, how can you spot with your back to the water skier? I have seen  
operators, oblivious to rocks jutting out of the water, running down loons,  
cutting off slow-moving fishing boats. I have been personally cut off in my  
path while water skiing. I have heard the mournful shrill of a loon calling  
out to her mate with the approach of a fast moving watercraft. How can you  
pick up an injured or tired skier if you already have a passenger with you on  
your watercraft?

I don't pay my waterfront taxes to have my solitude interrupted by the  
buzzing of one of those personal watercrafts.

People who sell these things are very conscientious, the majority of the  
people who buy them are not.

The key phrase is this, "How are we going to make people use them wisely?"  
Mandatory training and education including a practical exam, you need one for  
motorcycles and automobiles, maybe this will work. I believe this is  
something the watercraft dealers should sponsor, but they should be  
implemented by an impartial party.

It is ignorance, inexperience, and lack of conscience that irritate me the  
most. But it is this population that is giving the jet skiers a bad  
reputation. They, by far, outweigh the responsible owners. It is unfortunate  
that the policing of these is left to the few game wardens we have on our  
fresh water lakes.

Theresa Richardson, Surry resident

To the editor:

My family, at a sand beach with another large family, are enjoying a  
wonderful day on quiet Spring River Lake in Township 10.

Suddenly from the other end of the lake, four personal watercraft machines  
zoom toward us, swinging around in a large circle, actually causing young  
children, mothers and fathers to immediately go to the beach, where they  
stand in awe as these machines were in front of us. The noise is awful. The  
peace and quiet of a pristine lake has been destroyed.

The people on these machines even stop in front of us. It seems that they  
may think we are impressed with their tremendous noise and circling  
maneuvers. To the man nearest us I say, "We don't need this, we don't need  
you!" He thrusts his finger up toward me then continues his circling for some  
five minutes. Then the four zoom toward the other end of the lake.

I operate a bed and breakfast business in Cherryfield. Spring River Lake is  
a primary recommendation for our visiting guests. Our local people love to  
take children to the lake. Personal watercraft, with the horrible noise and  
dangerous maneuvers, will destroy the quiet and beauty of their lake.

It is my hope that many Mainers will contact their state representatives and  
implore them to not give in to efforts of the people who want to sell these  
machines. And why any compromise? Ban them completely.

William Conway, Cherryfield resident
