<title>Experiments with Economic Principles: Free Sample Chapter</title> 
<hr>
<h1>Free Sample Chapter</h1>

<hr>

<p>
Using classroom experiments is easy, fun, and a very effective way to
teach students about economic concepts.  The easiest way for us to prove
this to you is to have you try one of our experiments in your own classroom.
Below you will find a sample chapter from
our book (in postscript format).  The sample chapter is a shortened version of
our first chapter, and it allows you to teach your students the basics
of markets and supply and demand theory.  

<p>
This experiment can be run in a single  
50-minute class period. It runs smoothly in  classes ranging in size from  12  
to 75 students 
(here is some <a href="large.html">information for using it in larger classes</a>).

<p>
Obviously, we hope that you will enjoy using our experiment and at the same time
be persuaded to use
more of our experiments in future classes.  The book can be used as either a free-standing
text or as a supplement to your current text.  You can order the entire book, or a 
custom-printed version that includes only the experiments of your choice.

<h3>Terms of Use</h3>

<p>
First some legal issues:
The authors and McGraw Hill retain all ownership rights to these sample chapters.
You have our permission to download the material for the purpose of making a single,
personal copy.  You have the right to use the materials in any course that is
<strong>currently</strong> being offered.  
Instructors may make copies of the student chapter for distribution to their students,

<h4>Student Chapter</h4>
<p>
If you agree to the "Terms of Use" above, you can go here to downlaod the 
<a href="studfreechap.html">free sample chapter for students</a>.
Each student in the class will need a copy.

<p>
<h4>Instructor's Manual</h4>
<p>
If you agree to the "Terms of Use" above, you can go here to downlaod the 
<a href="imfreechap.html">Instructor's Manual coinciding with the sample
chapter</a>.
The instructor of the course needs a single copy (it contains some general instructions
and some materials that you will need to copy
before running the experiment).  

<p>
(A note to students: We realize
that instructor's manuals hold a certain amount of intrigue for some students. 
Unfortunately, this manual doesn't contain any test questions, easy answers to
your homework, etc., but rather good discussions of the mechanics behind how
to conduct the experiment, and so forth.  You are welcome to download 
and read this document, though the easiest way to understand the material
and do well on your homework is to focus your time and effort towards the student chapter.)
