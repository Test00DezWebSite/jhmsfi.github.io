<title>Experiments with Economic Principles: Free Sample Chapter</title> 
<hr>
<h1>Free Sample Chapter</h1>

<hr>

<p>
Using classroom experiments is easy, fun, and a very effective way to
teach students about economic concepts.  
A simple  way for  you to test this  
proposition is to try an experiment in your own classroom.

<p>
To enable you to try an experiment, we are making available   
a shortened version of the first chapter of our book (in postscript format).
Once each student has a copy of the chapter, you will be able to conduct
a simple classroom market experiment that will allow your students to actively
experience a market, as well as learn the theory of supply and demand.
You will also find a chapter from our
Instructor's Manual that provides detailed instructions for running the  
experiment.  This experiment can be conducted  in a single 50-minute class  
period. It runs smoothly in  classes ranging in size from  12 to 75 students  
(here is some <a href="large.html">information for using it in larger classes</a>).

<p>
Obviously, we hope that you will enjoy using our experiment and at the same time
be persuaded to use
more of our experiments in future classes.  
The book includes twelve additional experiments, each designed to teach fundamental
economic ideas.
Among  the topics treated are sales taxes, prohibition, minimum wages, monopoly,   
entry and exit, externalities, information, bargaining, comparative  
advantage, and auctions.

<p>
You can order the entire book to use either as a free-standing text or as a  
supplement to your current text.  If you prefer to run  only a few  
experiments from the book, you can  order a custom-printed text that includes  
only the experiments of your choice.

<h3>Terms of Use</h3>

<p>
First some legal issues:
The authors and McGraw Hill retain all ownership rights to these sample chapters.
You have our permission to download the material for the purpose of making a single,
personal copy.  You have the right to use the materials in any course that is
<strong>currently</strong> being offered.  
Instructors may make copies of the student chapter for distribution to their students,

<h4>Student Chapter</h4>
<p>
If you agree to the "Terms of Use" above, you can go here to download the 
<a href="studfreechap.html">free sample chapter for students</a>.
Each student in the class will need a copy.

<p>
<h4>Instructor's Manual</h4>
<p>
If you agree to the "Terms of Use" above, you can go here to download the 
<a href="imfreechap.html">Instructor's Manual coinciding with the sample
chapter</a>.
The instructor of the course needs a single copy (it contains some general instructions
and some materials that you will need to copy
before running the experiment).  

<p>
(A note to students: We realize
that instructor's manuals hold a certain amount of intrigue for some students. 
Unfortunately, this manual doesn't contain any test questions, easy answers to
your homework, etc., but rather good discussions of the mechanics behind how
to conduct the experiment, and so forth.  You are welcome to download 
and read this document, though the easiest way to understand the material
and do well on your homework is to focus your time and effort towards the student chapter.)
