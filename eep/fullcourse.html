<title>  Experiments with Economic Principles: Sole Text </title> 
<hr>
<h1> Using the Book as the Sole Text </h1>

<hr>

Along with using the text as a supplement to enliven and enhance
a traditional "fat" book course, we have had great success basing
a course solely on the book.  Here is 
<a href="http://leon.econ.lsa.umich.edu/Courses/109/109.html">
Bergstrom's syllabus </a> from a Winter 1996 course, and
here is 
<a href="../teaching/syll110.html"> Miller's syllabus </a>
from his current course.  
<p>
Here is Miller's <a href="../teaching/88110schedule.html">
time schedule </a> for his course.  The course is based on a three
class rhythm (see below).   Before beginning the rhythm, two classes
are devoted to administrative details and overview lectures, and two
classes are used to discuss understanding observations (mainly how
to analyze data using graphs and statistics) and creating theories (what makes
a useful theory and how one might derive such a thing).  These latter two classes
are done after the start of the first experiment so that the students
have a natural context in which to use this information. 

<p>
The above course meets three days a week (50 minutes each meeting).
The typical rhythm I use is: 
<ul>
<li>
[Class Session 1]: run the experiment (and lab report and homework due
from previous experiment); 
<li>
[Class Session 2]: discussion of experiment;
<li>
[Class Session 3]: complete discussion and
provide broader implications and other applications of the theory.
</ul>
<p>
This general format scales up nicely to large classes if you 
run the experiments in smaller recitation sections.

<p>
For classes that meet two days a week (1:15 minutes each meeting),
I use:
<ul>
<li> 
[Class Session 1]:  run the experiment (and lab report and homework due from 
previous experiment), begin discussion.
<li>  
[Class Session 2]: complete discussion and
provide broader implications and other applications of the theory.
</ul>
<p>
Depending on your students and teaching style, you may want to have the 
lab report and homework due on different dates.
