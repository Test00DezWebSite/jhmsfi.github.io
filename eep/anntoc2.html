<h1> Annotated Table of Contents for  Experiments with Economic Principles: Microeconomics, 2nd Edition</h1>

<hr>

<p> The book is organized as a series of  
experiments.  Within each
experiment, there is a short description to be  
read by the students
prior to class, 
a discussion section that elucidates  
the appropriate
economic theory and principles, 
a lab notes section in which to collect the experimental data and
begin some
analysis, 
and a homework  
section that ties what
they found in the experiment to the theory.
<p> 

<hr> 

<h2> Part I:  Competitive Markets </h2> 

<ul> 

This section of the book teaches the fundamentals  
of supply and demand in a single market.
<p>

<li> <strong> Experiment 1: Supply and  
Demand</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd>This is a good way to
begin the class and get the students thinking  
about how markets work.
It teaches students to draw and understand  
step-function demand and
supply curves, and it gives them useful practice  
for later, more
elaborate experiments.  

</dl> 

<p>

<li> <strong> Experiment 2: Shifting Supply and  
Demand</strong> 

<dl>
<dd> This experiment illustrates the method of  
comparative statics with a shifting supply curve  
in a hypothetical fishing village.  The  
experiment also forces students to grapple with  
the concept of sunk costs. The discussion section  
presents  real-world examples of  shifts in  
supply and/or demand. This discussion is intended  
to teach them to determine in applications which  
curve shifted, and to distinguish shifts in a  
demand or supply curve from movements along the  
curve.  </dl> 

</ul> 


<p> 

<hr> 

<h2> Part II: Market Intervention and Public  
Policy </h2> 


<ul> 

Each of the experiments in this section  
demonstrates applications of  the basic theory of  
supply and demand to issues in public policy.<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 3: Sales Taxes</strong> 

<dl>
<dd> At last, they will figure out those shifts!   
Students get to
explore the implications of putting a tax on the  
buyers versus the
sellers.   Skeptics are finally convinced that a  
tax collected from demanders is equivalent to a  
tax collected from suppliers.  Students
also learn first-hand the meaning of "excess  
burden" of taxation.
</dl> 

<p> 


<li> <strong> Experiment 4: Prohibition</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd> Students seem to really enjoy this  
experiment, perhaps because of the
topic. They are often very much surprised that  
the simple economic theory they have learned
 provides powerful  
insights into the problems that arise from  
the government's "War on Drugs." </dl> 

<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 5: Minimum  
Wages</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd> The experiment imposes a minimum wage in a  
labor market. This experiment introduces a simple  
"theory of labor demand" in which  
profit-maximizing employers have diminishing  
marginal product of labor.  From the experiment, 
students also learn to define and measure  
voluntary and involuntary unemployment. The  
discussion and homework offer a general analysis  
of price floors and ceilings. 

</dl> 

<p>
</ul>

<p> 

<hr> 

<h2> Part III: Imperfect Markets </h2> 


<ul> 

These experiments present environments in which  
market outcomes are not expected to be efficient.     
The ideas here are useful both for understanding  
the workings of actual markets and for suggesting  
appropriate roles for government policy.
<p>


<li> <strong> Experiment 6:  
Externalities</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd> 

The effect of externalities
is brought home in a dramatic (and frustratingly  
real) way to most students.
A Pigovian tax, whose revenue is returned in  
equal
shares to all participants, is used to correct  
for the externality. 
The fact that a tax increases rather than
decreases total profits is a nice complement to  
the lesson on the
excess burden of a sales tax when there is no  
externality.  The final
session has two simultaneous markets, one for  
marketable
pollution permits, which
are present in fixed supply, and one for  
pollution-producing goods.
</dl> 

<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 7: Monopolies and  
Cartels</strong>
<dl> 

<dd> Students learn about monopoly pricing, price  
discrimination, and the formation and breakdown  
of cartels.  Students particularly enjoy watching
the cartels break apart, and this can lead to  
lively  discussions of collusion and cooperation.  
</dl> 

</ul>

<p> 

<hr> 

<h2> Part IV: Firms and Technology </h2> 

<ul> 

We have found that a good way to introduce  
students to the basic ideas of the theory of the  
firm is to gradually slip economists' notions of  
technology and costs into the design of the  
experiments, and let students who play the role of  
firms figure out how to behave before they are  
exposed to abstract theories.  Some of this has  
already been done in the earlier experiments on   
shifting supply curves, sales taxes,  minimum  
wages, and externalities.  We pursue the theory  
of the firm further in these experiments. <p>
<p>

<li> <strong> Experiment 8: Entry and Exit  
</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd>  This experiment has two-stages:  
an "entry stage" and "market stage."  In the  
entry stage, firms
sequentially and publicly announce their  
intentions to enter or not
enter a local restaurant  industry.  Firms who  
enter  must pay a fixed
cost regardless of the number of meals they sell.   
Each has constant
marginal cost and a fixed capacity.  In the  
market stage, firms sell
meals to consumers. If the number of entrants is  
"too small" there will be profits, attracting more  
entrants in the next
round. If the number of entrants is "too large"  
there are losses, and
in  later rounds there are likely to be fewer  
entrants.
These results lead to a natural discussion about long- versus  
short-run equilibria.
</dl> 

<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 9: Network Externalities
</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd>  
This chapter is all about E-conomics---the economics of the information age.
What good is a fax machine if you have the only one?  How did Microsoft
come to dominate the market for computer operating systems?
The first session of this experiment introduces the idea of network externalities
and explores the workings of a market for a good that becomes more valuable to
everyone as more people purchase it.  The second and third sessions of this
experiment feature fierce battles for market supremacy between competing 
computer operating systems, in an environment where the strong are likely
to devour the weak.
</dl> 

<p> 


<li> <strong> Experiment 10: Measuring  
Productivity</strong>
<dl> 

<dd>
A vivid illustration of a real production  
function (paper airplane folding).
Students seem to enjoy this, even though trees  
often object.
</dl> 

<p> 


<li> <strong> Experiment 11: Comparative  Advantage</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd>
A simple illustration of comparative advantage,
the gains from international trade, and even  
general equilibrium.  After doing this lab,  
students find the notion of comparative
advantage easy to grasp.
</dl> 

<p> 


</ul>

<p> 


<hr> 

<h2> Part IV: Information, Auctions, and  
Bargaining </h2>  

<ul> 
These topics often get little or no attention in  
standard principles texts. Nevertheless, they are  
each closely related to students' practical  
experience in actual markets, and each of these  
topics has been a success story for the methods  
of modern economics. These experiments have been  
very popular with our students, who have had  
little difficulty in grasping these ideas. 
<p>


<li> <strong> Experiment 12: Adverse  
Selection</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd> This experiment is based on George Akerlof's  
"Lemons" model.   
Ideas about adverse selection and moral hazard  
are developed, along
with more advance topics like separating
equilibrium, pooling equilibrium, and  
self-confirming beliefs.   While these may be difficult
topics to teach abstractly, the experiments allow easy access
to these ideas.
</dl> 

<p> 


<li> <strong> Experiment 13: Auctions</strong> 

<dl> 

<dd> The auction experiment has been popular with  
our students, who seem to be very curious about  
how auctions actually work, and very pleased to  
discover that a bit of simple theorizing  
contributes much to their understanding.  

</dl> 

<p> 


<li> <strong> Experiment 14: Bargaining</strong>
<dl> 

<dd> We offer a series of sequential-bargaining   
experiments, motivated by a hypothetical sale of  
a bicycle. This experiment allows students to  
learn a bit of bargaining theory and simple game  
theory.  The discussion briefly introduces  
students to some of the results in the large body  
of experimental research on this bargaining  
environment. 

</dl> 

<p> 

</ul>

<hr> 

<h2> Appendix: Further Economic Principles 
</h2>  

<ul>
The appendix covers a variety of topics that naturally
fit with many of the chapters.  The experiments do not require
this knowledge, but depending on the course goals, instructors 
may want to include some of these topics.  
Topics include smooth supply and
demand curves, comparative statics, and elasticity.
