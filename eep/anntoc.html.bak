<title>  Experiments with Economic Principles: Annotated TOC </title> 

<hr> 

<h1> Annotated Table of Contents</h1>

<hr>

<p> The book is organized as a series of experiments.  Within each
experiment, there is a short description to be read by the students
prior to class, a lab report in which to collect the data and begin some
analysis, a discussion section that elucidates the appropriate
economic theory and principles, and a homework section that ties what
they found in the experiment to the theory.

<h2> Part I:  Competitive Markets </h2> 
<ul> 
This section of the book teaches the fundamentals of supply and demand.
<p>

<li> <strong> Experiment 1: Supply and Demand</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd>This is a good way to
begin the class and get the students thinking about how markets work.
It teaches students to draw and understand step-function demand and
supply curves, and it gives them useful practice for later, more
elaborate experiments.  
</dl> 
<p>

<li> <strong> Experiment 2: Shifting Supply and Demand</strong> 
<dl>
<dd> This experiment teaches the basics about shifting supply and demand
curves, and also provides some insights into a simple production system
(with fixed costs).  Even if you don't run the experiment, the
discussion and homework sections may be assigned.
</dl> 
</ul> 

<p> 
<hr> 
<h2> Part II: Market Intervention and Public Policy </h2> 

<ul> 
Each of the experiments in this section are nice illustrations
of how you can use the basic theory of supply and demand to study
some important real-world phenomena.
<p> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 3: Sales Taxes</strong> 
<dl>
<dd> Finally, they will figure out those shifts!  Students get to
explore the implications of putting a tax on the buyers versus the
sellers.   Skeptics are finally convinced of the equivalence of a tax
collected from demanders to a tax collected from suppliers.  Students
also learn first-hand the meaning of "excess burden" of taxation.
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 4: Prohibition</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> Students seem to really enjoy this experiment, perhaps because of the
topic.  Fundamentally, it is a nice application of some basic
competitive equilibrium theory, and it ties nicely to some real
policy debates.  
</dl> 
<p> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 5: Minimum Wages</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> In addition to learning about the
effects of market controls like price ceilings and floors, students learn
to define and measure voluntary and involuntary unemployment. 
</dl> 
<p>
</ul>

<p> 
<hr> 
<h2> Part III: Imperfect Markets </h2> 

These experiments provide nice illustrations of how market
imperfections influence free market outcomes.  Along with
developing a further understanding of the importance of
various underlying assumptions, they also provide a nice
bridge to discussing economic policy analysis.
<p>

<ul> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 6: Externalities</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> 
The effect of externalities
is brought home in a dramatic (and frustratingly real) way to most students.
A Pigovian tax, whose revenue is returned in equal
shares to all participants, is used to correct for the externality. 
The fact that a tax increases rather than
decreases total profits is a nice complement to the lesson on the
excess burden of a sales tax when there is no externality.  The final
session has two simultaneous markets, one for pollution permits, which
are present in fixed supply, and one for pollution-producing goods.
</dl> 
<p> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 7: Monopolies and Cartels</strong>
<dl> 
<dd> Students learn about monopoly pricing, price discrimination,
and how cartels can break down.  Moreover, some basic ideas about
maximizing profits and costs are developed.
Students particularly enjoy watching
the cartels break apart, and this can lead to lively  discussions of
free riding behavior.  
</dl> 
</ul>

<p> 
<hr> 
<h2> Part IV: Firms and Technology </h2> 

These experiments provide some basic ideas about the theory of
firm competition and production.
<p>
<ul> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 8: Entry and Exit </strong> 
<dl> 
<dd>  This experiment has two-stages:  
an "entry stage" and "market stage."  In the entry stage, firms
sequentially and publicly announce their intentions to enter or not
enter a local restaurant  industry.  Firms who enter  must pay a fixed
cost regardless of the number of meals they sell.  Each has constant
marginal cost and a fixed capacity.  In the market stage, firms sell
meals to consumers. If the number of entrants is "too
small" there will be profits, attracting more entrants in the next
round. If the number of entrants is "too large" there are losses, and
in  later rounds there are likely to be fewer entrants.
From this a discussion about long- versus short-run equilibria is
developed.
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 9: Measuring Productivity</strong>
<dl> 
<dd>
A vivid illustration of a real production function (paper airplane folding).
Students seem to enjoy this, even though tress often object.
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 10: Comparative Advantage</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd>
A simple illustration of the ideas behind comparative advantage,
international trade, and even general equilibrium.  After doing
this lab, students seem to finally get the basic ideas of comparative
advantage.
</dl> 
<p> 

</ul>

<h2> Part IV: Information, Auctions, and Bargaining </h2> 
A varitey of nice topics are in this section.  The adverse selection
experiment can nicely complement those done in imperfect markets above.
Auctions are a fun thing for the students to learn about, and even
if you don't do the entire chapter, make sure you try the common-value
experiment and the dollar auction.  Students also seem to enjoy
learning about bargaining, and from this you can begin discussions
of other game theoretic topics if you so desire.


<ul> 
<li> <strong> Experiment 11: Adverse Selection</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> This experiment is based on George Akerlof's "Lemons" model.   
Ideas about adverse selection and moral hazard are developed, along
with more advance topics like separating
equilibrium, pooling equilibrium, and self-confirming beliefs.
Students can easily understand these topics once they do the
experiment..
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 12: Auctions</strong> 
<dl> 
<dd> Auction theory is a lovely topic, as students seem to have some
intuitive knowledge of these topics, yet there is so much more they
can discover through a few simple experiments.
</dl> 
<p> 

<li> <strong> Experiment 13: Bargaining</strong>
<dl> 
<dd> Using a series of "divide the pie" experiments, students can
learn about bargaining theory and game theory more generally. Also,
this is a nice illustration of how theories of rational thought can
be used to explain real-world phenomena.  (Of course, in this case some
alternative hypotheses are also worthy of consideration.)
