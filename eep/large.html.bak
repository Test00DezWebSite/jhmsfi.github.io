<h1> Using the Book in Large Classes </h1>

<hr>
Most of the experiments are designed to work with classes of 
60 students or less.  Obviously, a lot of principles classes
are above this size.  
<p>
Here are some suggestions for larger classes:

<p>
<ul>

<li> <strong> Run the experiments in recitations: </strong>
In classes that have a large lecture as well as several  
smaller recitation sections, 
these experiments can be run in the recitation sessions.   
Experiments in the recitations give students  a stronger  
incentive to attend these sessions and  allows students to  
interact in relatively small groups.  Recitation based
experiments are also an  
attractive way of making effective use of 
teaching assistants who vary in skill and experience.

<strong>
Break the class into smaller groups and run the experiments simultaneously: 
</strong>
You can divide your class into appropriate sized groups
and run the experiments simultaneously.  You need to make sure
that the groups have enough separation, so that subjects in one
session don't inadvertently wander into another session.  Thus, you
should designate widely separated ``landmarks'' 
for each group to congregate around,
and some territorial boundaries that are not to be crossed.  
You should be able to handle all of the preliminaries for each
experiment (discussion of basic procedures, warm-up exercises, and the answering of any questions)
in front of the entire class before splitting into groups.  Each group will
need a market manager.  TAs are an obvious choice, but students from the class will
also work---you may want to talk to them ahead of time, but in reality the skills
required are minimal (hand out personal information sheets, keep track of incoming forms, and 
post prices).  To keep the groups separate and minimize confusion, you may want to print up
the materials for each group on separate colors of paper.
Finally, when ever you are managing a group of this size remember to do the following:
tell them not to move until you give complete instructions, then tell them where to go
and how to assemble once they get there, and finally what to do when they are done,
finally, tell them to move.

<p>
<li>
<strong>
Assign teams to manage the activity of each subject:
</strong>
If you have, say, 180 students, you can always assign three people
per personal information sheet, and have them act as a team.
Often times, teams have the advantage in that they can discuss 
various ways to play the game among themselves, and in so doing, gain some useful
insights about the problem.  Make sure the each team understands that
it must act as a unit, and therefore it can not do anything that
would violate the rules for an individual player (for example, make two deals when only one is
allowed, etc.).  You can either have the whole team get up and participate
in each session, or you may want to have only one representative from each
team come down into the trading area for each session.  If you do this, make
sure that the team members rotate who is sent into the trading area.

<p>
<li>
<strong>
Have the larger class watch a sample group:
</strong>
You can always randomly pick a subgroup of students (50 or so) and have them run the
experiment in front of the rest of the class.  For many of the experiments,
the process of watching the market is quite informative (especially if you
give the observers some key things to look for (and think about) before the market gets
underway).  Obviously, those students who are not in the experiment, lose some
of the impact of direct participation---this can be mitigated by having the 
students who particpated in the experiment trade-off with those who have only been
observing. For example, at the end of each session, have each of the students in
the experiment hand their Personal Information Sheet to someone who has not yet
participated.

<p>
<li>
<strong>
Conduct the experiments in the large session:
</strong>
We have developed techniques to run some
of the market experiments (Experiments 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 should work) in 
large classes (there is nothing like
watching 350 people erupt in a flurry of trading activity).
In this scheme, students don't need to come down to a trading area, but rather are
allowed to negotiate with their neighbors.  Since  
this occurs simultaneously, the process is quick even for  
large classes. (You might think that the lack of information about sales
prices would hamper this process, but in fact, there is a lot of information
about prices floating around in terms of the bids and offers that are being
overheard by the students.)  You will need to develop some system for
collecting and reporting the signed contracts.    A few teaching assistants  
or students from the class can be assigned to stay in the aisles and do this job 
(each should be given some Sales Contracts ahead of time), you will also need to
designate a ``runner'' or two to go up and down the aisles collecting completed
contracts from the TAs or designated students and bringing them down front for you to post.  
Given the size of this market, it would be a great burden to the students if they had to
complete the lab reports with all of the actual transactions (since they need
to calculate profit for each trade, graph all transactions, etc.).
<em> Therefore, make the following modifications. </em> 
Rather than report all of the data, you should create a sample market of a more convenient (under
60) size,
say, 50 participants.   To do this, report buyer values and seller costs as if you only
handed out personal information sheets to 50 students.  Then, report every n/50th (where n is the
actual class size at the experiment) transaction.  Thus, if you had 250 students, use every 5th
transaction.  (If n/50 is not close to an integer value, then adjust the number of participants
until you get a value relatively close, for example, if you have 230 participants, you could
have a market of say, 46 buyers and sellers, sampling every 5th transaction.)
