The Zen way of calligraphy is to write in the most straightforward, simple way as
if you were a beginner, not trying to make something skillful or beautiful, but
simply writing with full attention as if you were discovering what you were writing
for the first time; then your full nature will be in the writing.  This is the way
of practice, moment after moment." &nbsp;&nbsp; Richard Baker.

"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few."

"The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert, ready to
accept, to doubt, and open to all the possibilities.  It is the kind of mind which
can see things as they are, which step by step and in a flash realize the 
original nature of everything." &nbsp;&nbsp; Richard Baker.
