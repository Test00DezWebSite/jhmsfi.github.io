Some Thoughts on Teaching

These might be better titled ``thoughts on learning.'' In any
event, over the years I've collected a variety of quotes that
I have found to be insightful about what it means to learn and
teach.  JHM

We have to look for routes of power our teachers never imagined, or
were encouraged to avoid.

<li> Your study should be broad and diversified.  Do not limit yourself.

<li> Examine and question.  Ask yourself how and why something 
works.  Be receptive to what others ignore.

<li> Be deliberate and careful in your thinking.  Use your mind to
discover proper understanding.  

<li> Clearly examine. Separate concepts distinctly, then decide
upon the proper course.  

<li> Practice sincerely.

It then occurred to me that this was not the first time I had been
given a map which failed to show many things I could see right in front
of my eyes.  All through school and university I had been given maps of
life and knowledge on which there was hardly a trace of many of the
things that I most cared about and that seemed to me to be of the
greatest possible importance to the conduct of my life.  I remembered
that for many years my perplexity had been complete; and no interpreter
had come along to help me.  It remained complete until I ceased to
suspect the sanity of my perceptions and began, instead, to suspect the
soundness of my maps.

The master shook his head.  ``I could answer your questions but I 
won't try because you wouldn't understand the answer.  Now listen.
Imagine that I am holding a pot of tea, and you are thirsty.  You
want me to give you tea.  I can pour tea but you'll have to produce
a cup.  I can't pour the tea on your hands or you'll get burnt.  If I
pour it on the floor I shall spoil the floormats.  You have to have
a cup.  That cup you will form in yourself by the training you will
receive here.''

This does not mean a closed mind, but actually an empty mind
and a ready mind.  If your mind is empty, it is always ready for
anything; it is open to everything.
In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in
the expert's mind there are few.

A sage of Chelm went bathing in the lake and almost drowned.
When he raised an outcry other swimmers came to his rescue.  As he
was helped out of the water he took a solemn oath: ``I swear never to go
into the water again until I learn how to swim!''

The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert, 
ready to accept, to doubt, and open to all the possibilities...
The Zen way of calligraphy is to write in the most
straightforward, simple way as if you were a beginner, not trying to
make something skillful or beautiful, but simply writing with full
attention as if you were discovering what you were writing for the
first time;

I warn you.  Look at every path closely and deliberately.
Try it as many times as you think necessary.  Then ask yourself,
and yourself alone, one question.  This question is one that
only a very old man asks.  My benefactor told me about it
once when I was young, and my blood was too vigorous for me
to understand it.  Now I do understand it.  I will tell you what
it is: Does this path have a heart?

To read well, that is to read true books in a true spirit,
is a noble exercise.

Not many years ago I began to play the cello.  Most people would 
say that what I am doing is ``learning to play'' the cello.
But these words carry into our minds the strange idea that
there exists two very different processes: 1) learning to play
the cello; and 2) playing the cello.  They imply that I will
do the first until I have completed it, at which point I will
stop the first process and begin the second; in short, that I will
go on ``learning to play'' until I have ``learned to play'' and that then
I will begin to play.  Of course, this is nonsense.  There are not two
processes, but one.  We learn to do something by doing it.  There is
no other way.
