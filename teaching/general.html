<strong> TOPICS: </strong>
While there is a certain set of core ideas which we must
cover, there is enough flexibility in the schedule to allow for the
addition (or subtraction) of certain topics.  If you think of any
useful changes please let me know.  During the term, it may become
apparent to either you or me that the course would be greatly enhanced
by some other modifications (e.g., changes in the required readings,
homework, etc.).  Please feel free to make such suggestions.  Any major
changes will be openly discussed before being implemented.

<p>
<A name="feedback"></A>
<strong> FEEDBACK: </strong>
If at any time you are unsure about your performance in
the class, please let me know, and I will try and provide you with as
much useful information as possible.  Similarly, useful comments as to
the quality of the course (including suggestions for improvement, if
possible) are always welcome and can easily be made at any time via the
online course evaluation.  
Depending on the class size, I may
ask for volunteers to meet with me on a regular basis
during the semester.  These representatives will act as advocates for
all of the students (and should continually solicit input from their peers) and 
will provide additional and immediate 
feedback about how to improve the course.  

<p>
<A name="questions"></A>
<strong> QUESTIONS: </strong>
Feel free to ask questions and make comments during
the lectures. I will try and answer all questions, but
there may be occasions when I find it necessary to postpone answers
until a more appropriate time. Your questions and comments are vital to
the development and direction of the course.  Please do not be shy
about asking questions (when was the last time that someone asked a
question and you felt 100% confident that you could give the right
answer?).

<p>
<A name="readings"></A>
<strong> READINGS: </strong>
Effective learning in this class will require you to
have read the material before it is actually discussed. Thus, please
pace your reading in relation to the time schedule so that you are
ahead of the class discussion.  Unless otherwise specified, you will be
responsible for knowing all of the listed readings, as well as any
readings announced during class.

<p>
<A name="office"></A>
<strong> OFFICE: </strong>
I encourage you to come and see me at my office.  If you
have a quick question or special circumstances, please drop by at any
time.  I would like not to limit my availability, so if it looks like I
am deep in thought or otherwise engaged, and your question can wait,
please come by at a later time. For more extensive questions, I prefer
that you use the specified <a href="contactjhm.html">office hours</a>),
so far as possible.  If for
some reason the office hours are inconvenient, I am quite willing to
make special appointments.

<p>
It is often difficult for me to get to know your name and interests
through only our class interactions.  ***Thus, during the <EM> first week
of class </EM>, make sure to come by my office and introduce yourself.***

<p>
<A name="attendance"></A>
<strong> ATTENDANCE: </strong>
I  would hope that the lectures presented during
class will be engaging enough that you feel compelled to attend.
Although there is no formal attendance policy (other than for exams),
you are expected to attend class and excessive absenteeism should be
avoided.  You are responsible for knowing any modifications to the
course announced in class.  Insofar as possible, lectures will
complement, and not substitute for, outside material.  This fact will
be reflected in exams.  Moreover, attendance and participation are one
of the few signals available for judging your effort at understanding
the material.  If you find that attending classes is not worthwhile,
for whatever reason, please come and see me so we can discuss the
situation.

<p>
Class will begin promptly at the appointed starting time.  
The beginning of the class is an integral
and critical part of the lecture, so please try and be on time.
I will always try to end class on time---in the event that I exceed
the allotted time, gentle reminders are always welcome.

<p>
<A name="grading"></A>
<strong> GRADING: </strong>
Ultimately, your grade in the course should reflect
your ability and effort directed at learning and understanding the
material presented in class.  If you feel that for some personal reason
the current grading system will not be able to accurately accomplish
this, then please come and see me <em> as soon as possible </em> so that we
can make alternative arrangements.  I reserve some latitude to modify
the specified grading system for cases in which it is not able to
accurately reflect the above criteria.  <em> If you ever receive a below
average grade on course work, I expect you to come and see me during
office hours,</em> also you should read and act on the following
<a href="dobetter.html"> suggestions for doing better</a>.  
Any time you have a question about the exact criteria for
grading a particular assignment, please ask for an immediate
clarification.  Please note the <a href="#deadlines">deadlines policy</a> below.

<p>
In general, the grading process I use is as follows.
For each individual assignment I employ a variety of techniques 
to make sure that the grading is consistent. Both the absolute
number of points and a measure of how you did relative to others
in the class are then recorded (this latter measure allows me to
adjust for differences in difficulty and teaching from year to year).
At the end of the semester, I rank students based on the two measures
of performance.
Once the ranks are determined, I look for natural breaks that might
be useful in grouping students.  I look for
breaks that are large enough so that typical errors in grading will
not make a difference.  Once the groups are determined, 
I spend <em> a lot </em> of time looking
at those individuals who are on the borderline, and try and
make the best possible case for moving them into the <em> higher </em> 
category.  (I look at a variety of factors during this evaluation, including:
unusual events, improvement over time,
good attendance and use of office hours, expressions of concern
and extra effort focused on learning the material, etc.)  
Once the final groups have been determine, each member in a given group is 
assigned the same grade.  I do not use a set distribution of final grades---the
final distribution will depend on the intrinsic performance of the individuals
in the class.  If you have any suggestions that would improve the grading 
system please let me know.

<p>
Please keep a personal copy (electronic, xerox, etc.) of any material
you submit for a grade.  Always retain your course work until you
receive your final grade in the class.

<p>
If you feel that a project, homework, exam, etc., has been graded incorrectly, please
submit, <em>in writing</em>, an explanation of the error.  When such items are
submitted for review, I reserve the <em> right to regrade the entire item</em>.
Any issues with grading must be submitted to me, unless otherwise specified,
<em> within one week</em> after 
the graded material is available to the class.   After this one week period, no
changes will be made in recorded grades.

<A name="deadlines"></A>
<p>
<strong> DEADLINES: </strong>
Unless otherwise specified, assignments are always due
at the <em> beginning </em> of class on the designated date (if class is not
scheduled on the designated date, then the assignment should be delivered to my
office before 5pm).  If you are
unable to submit course work or take an exam due to a schedule
conflict, illness, concurrent other work or exams, etc., you must
submit, <em> in writing</em>, a request for an extension, giving the reason
why (including outside documentation if available) and a new
completion deadline.  Such notifications must be presented for my 
approval in a <em> timely </em> manner (prior to the event if it is
foreseeable).  Getting an extension is very easy for legitimate
reasons.  <em>As you will see below, the penalty for having 
unexcused late work is severe, so either turn it in on time or
get permission for turning it in late!</em>

<p>
<strong>***If you fail to obtain permission in a timely
manner, you will receive a zero for that assignment***</strong>  
Note that receiving a
zero will seriously impact your overall grade in the course, since
average grades on assignments are well above 0!  (For example,
suppose the class averages 80% on graded work.  If you do not turn in
an assignment worth 20% of the grade, then you will have to 
have
perfect (100%) scores on the remainder of the material just to achieve
an average score in the class!)  Thus, avoid putting yourself in an impossible
position, and make sure you turn in your assignments on time. 

<p>
<A name="exams"></A>
<strong> EXAMS: </strong>
Prior to any exam, as much (reasonable) information as
possible about the exam will be provided.  This information will
include potential coverage (reading material, etc.), exam format (types
and allocation of questions), etc.

<p>
<A name="writtenwork"></A>
<strong> WRITTEN WORK: </strong>
Submitted written work should demonstrate the
ability to communicate ideas inspired by an intellectual adeptness and
curiosity with the material.  Unless otherwise specified, all
submitted written work should be in a final and polished form
(including appropriate spelling and grammar, standard format,
12 pt text, standard type-face, double-spaced, etc.).

<p>
<A name="webpage"></A>
<strong> WEB PAGE: </strong>
You should become familiar with all of the material on the class
web page.  I will assume that everyone will
check this page at least once every 48 hours for newly posted announcements.  
You will also be able to download important files from this site, as
well as discuss general issues on its bulletin board.

<p>
<A name="recording"></A>
<strong> RECORDING: </strong>
No student may record or tape any classroom activity without 
the express written consent of Prof.  John H. Miller.
If a student believes that he/she is disabled
and needs to record or tape classroom activities, he/she should contact
the Office of Disability Resources to request an appropriate
accommodation.

<p>
<A name="disabilities"></A>
<strong> DISABILITIES: </strong>
The Office of Equal Opportunity Services provides support services for both
physically disabled and learning disabled students.  For individualized
academic adjustment based on a documented disability, contact Equal
Opportunity Services at eos@andrew.cmu.edu or (412) 268-2012.


<p>
<A name="cheating"></A>
<strong> CHEATING: </strong>
<em> Cheating and dishonesty are unacceptable, 
will not be tolerated, and you will be held to a high standard in this regard</em>.  
You may not represent other people's ideas or work as your own.
Please make yourself familiar with the 
<a href="http://policy.andrew.cmu.edu/univ_policy/documents/Cheating.html">
current University policy regarding cheating and plagiarism</a>.  
This type of behavior is unfair to you, your
classmates, and to me.  Measures will be taken to detect cheating.  
If cheating is detected we will follow the
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html">
procedures for academic disciplinary actions</a> 
and seek the maximum penalty possible.

<p>
<hr>

Both you and I are responsible for following the above
ideas.  I hope they will enhance class, and I look forward to any
additional suggestions you may have.
