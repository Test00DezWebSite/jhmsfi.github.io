<h1> 73/88-110 Experiments with Economic Principles, Fall 2002 </h1>

<hr>
<ul>
<strong> Goal: </strong> 
This course is designed to teach you the basic principles of economics, and
in so doing give you a better understanding of how individuals and societies
make key choices.
<P>
This course differs from a conventional social science course in that
we present all of the relevant 
material through the use of in-class experiments rather than lectures.
The use of experiments makes class both more
enjoyable and insightful.  
One nice feature of economic experiments is that you can be both a participant
and an observer, and you often will learn nearly as much about economic
principles from your experience as a participant as you will from your
analysis as an observer.
Given the difficulty of reproducing the 
experiments on your own, make sure you always attend and participate 
during these sessions.
At the conclusion of each experiment, it
is time to really put economics to the test---can economic theory explain
the complex interactions of the participants in your experiments?
<P>
After the experiment you will need to try and organize your 
thoughts about what occurred and 
discover the underlying principles of the system.  
This is not an easy thing to do, but your skill will 
improve with practice.  
<P>
I hope that you will leave the class with both a deep 
understanding of what I feel are some of the 
most important principles underlying social decisions 
and also a general set of skills that will allow you to 
discover new ideas on your own.
<P>

with Economic Principles: Microeconomics SECOND edition</cite></a>,

<p>
<li> You also need to register as a student at 
<A HREF="http://zuni.hss.cmu.edu/econu.html">EconU.com</a>.
I will announce the needed "course code" in class.  Make sure you
register and enroll by 3:00 pm, Thursday, 29 August, 2002, or you will
miss the first experiment. 

<p>
<li> On occasion, you may need to download some 
<a href="88110"> files</a> for the in-class experiments.  (These will
also have links from the syllabus.)

<p>
<li> An important part of the class is connecting the material we
learn with the real world.  
For each chapter, we have begun a collection of relevant
<a href="http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/eep/news2.html">
newspaper articles</a>, make sure you read them as we work through the
material.
You may also want to keep track of the
<a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/time/daily"> Time daily news summary</a>
or similar services for news about real policy
making.  Here is a link to the
<a href="http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/index.html"> Iowa Political
Stock Market</a>.
If you're interested, you can get information on all of the 
<a href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/economics/"> Nobel prize
winners in economics </a> (a particularly interesting story is the
one about the "Lost Years" of John Nash).
Of course, you also may want to know a few
<a href="http://netec.wustl.edu/JokEc.html"> economist jokes</a>.
