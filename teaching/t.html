88-110 EconX Instructions

<h2> Fall, 2004 </h2>
<hr>

<P>
Friends,
<P>
We are going to test the new online experiment system called EconX.
I realize that this is a bit of a bother, but I do want to get your
feedback on the new system given your experience with EconU.
<p>
To use the new system, you need to do the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Go to the <A HREF="http://www.econx.com">EconX web site</A>.
<LI> Click on "Register for EconX" and enter the requested
data.
<LI> When it asks for the "Course Admit Code" enter "110" (but
without the quotes, that is, just the number 110).
<LI> You should be all set from there, and things will look more
or less familar.  
<LI> When you go back to the site, you no longer need to register, just
click on the "LOG IN" button.
</UL>
