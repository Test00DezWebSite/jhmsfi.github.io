John's Advising Statement

<h1>
Some Thoughts on Advising
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Different faculty have different ideas about the role of an advisor.  I
feel that the major role of an advisor is to act as your advocate in
the academic system.  As your advocate I will try and smooth your path
through CMU when possible.  In the past, I have tried to get students
into closed classes, keep them off academic suspension, clarified
problems with their professors, make alternative educational
arrangements, etc.

<p>
I have relatively strong feelings about what education should and
should not be, and I am willing to work towards these goals with my
advisees.  I often put myself in somewhat precarious situations for my
students, and thus if I am going to act as your advocate, <em>I expect
you to be completely honest and to have right intention and attitude
when you approach me with a question or problem</em>.

<p>
I am also quite willing to provide you with information and advice (or,
at least, some alternative sources of information) about classes,
teachers, life, etc.  You should always feel free to openly and
actively question any advice I give you during our discussions, and you
should never seek advice about major decisions from just one source.

<p>
In exchange for the above, I expect you to take active responsibility
for your education and your life.  <em> One major expectation is that
you are responsible for making sure the courses you take will meet all
graduation requirements </em> 
(I am, of course, happy to provide information
on those requirements, suggest useful alternatives, etc.).  You are
also responsible for getting the most you possibly can out of your
education and your self.

<p>
Here are the easiests ways to <a href="contactjhm.html"> contact me </a>.
Please note that advising is only one of
many of my activities.  If you have a quick question or special
circumstances, please drop by at any time.  I would like not to limit
my availability, so if it looks like I am deep in thought or otherwise
engaged, and your question can wait, please come by at a later time.
For more extensive questions, it is best if you make a prior
appointment with me.

<p>

<p>
Please carefully read the above and decide for yourself whether or not
the advising role I describe is the one that you will most benefit
from.  For many people, it will not be what they want or need, and we
can easily find someone else who will be more appropriate.  If, on the
other hand, you find the above appealing, then by submitting an 
<a href="advisingform.html"> advisee form </a> you are acknowledging
that we will both do our best to follow the above.

<p>
John
