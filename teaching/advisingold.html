<strong> All new advisees </strong> should make sure
they read and fully understand my

If, after reading this statement, you feel that you cannot
abide by it, then come and 
<a href="contactjhm.html">see me </a> immediately.

<p>
<strong> All advisees </strong> should make sure that they
have submitted an 
<a href="advisingform.html"> advisee form </a>. The first time
you submit the form, please fill it out <em> completely </em>.
At the beginning of each subsequent academic year, you should 
submit a new form by completing the ``name'' section and
updating only those sections that have changed since the previous
