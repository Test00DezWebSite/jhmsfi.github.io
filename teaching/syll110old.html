<h1> 73/88-110 Social Decision Making, Fall 1999 </h1>
<h2> (aka Experiments with Economic Principles) </h2>

<hr>
<ul>
<strong> Goal: </strong> 
A major part of social science is devoted to the study of how individuals 
and societies make choices.  
The purpose of this course is for you to gain a deep understanding of this topic.
<P>
This course differs from a conventional social science course in that
we present all of the relevant 
material through the use of in-class experiments rather than lectures.
It is our hope that the use of experiments will make the class both 
enjoyable and insightful.  The 
experiments will allow you to directly participate in the abstract 
ideas discussed in the class (this tends to 
make learning much easier).  
Given the difficulty of reproducing the 
experiments on your own, make sure you always attend and participate 
during these sessions.
<P>
After the experiment you will need to try and organize your 
thoughts about what occurred and 
discover the underlying principles of the system.  
This is not an easy thing to do, but your skill will 
improve with practice.  
<P>
We hope that you will leave the class with both a deep 
understanding of what we feel are some of the 
most important principles underlying social decisions 
and a general set of skills that will allow you to 
discover new ideas on your own.
<P>

<p>
<li> On occasion, you may need to download some 
<a href="88110"> files</a>.

<p>
<li> An important part of the class is connecting the material we
learn with the real world.  
For each chapter, we have begun a collection of relevant
<a href="http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/eep/news.html">
newspaper articles</a>, make sure you read them as we work through the
material.
You may also want to keep track of the
<a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/time/daily"> Time daily news summary</a>
or similar services for news about real policy
making.  Here is a link to the
<a href="http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/index.html"> Iowa Political
Stock Market</a>.
If you're interested, you can get information on all of the 
<a href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/economics/"> Nobel prize
winners in economics </a> (a particularly interesting story is the
one about the "Lost Years" of John Nash).
Of course, you also may want to know a few
