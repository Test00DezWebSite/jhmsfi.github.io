Both of the discussion boards have been turned off by
making them not readable to group and other....just change
them back to get it all up and running next time.

Also, I cleaned out the msgs88xxx.html files.
These files contain the old discussions, and to
start anew, just wipe them clean of all html 
code and text.  (The program will insert the
appropriate stuff when needed.)

Eventually, I may want to move to a better format, 
like what I use for the book's bboard.
