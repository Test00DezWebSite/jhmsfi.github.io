<h1> A Simple Market Experiment </h1>
<hr>

<p>

<h3> Instructions:</h3>

This market is very similar to the first experiment in 
<a href="http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/teaching/eep.html">
Experiments with Economic Principles</a>.
You may want to read these instructions completely, and then "reload"
this page to begin a new experiment.
<p>
You will either be a Buyer (with a Buyer Value) or a Seller
(with a Seller Cost).  This information is available in the lower-right
side of the display.
You will be allowed to make only a single transaction during 
a given market session.
<p>
If you are a buyer, your Buyer Value gives you the value you will 
receive if you purchase a good on the market (in essence, it tells you how much
the good is worth to you).
Thus, if your buyer value is 80 and you
purchase a good for 73, then you will have earned a profit of 7.
If you do not purchase a good, you will receive a profit of 0.
<p> 
If you are a seller, your Seller Cost gives you the cost you must
pay if you sell a good on the market.
(You can think of this as your cost to produce 
the good.)
Thus, if your seller cost is 65 and you
sell a good for 73, then you will have earned a profit of 8.
If you do not sell a good, you will receive a profit of 0.
<p>
To make an offer in the market go to the lower-right
side of the display, and use
your mouse to click on the open circle by the value you wish to offer
(black circles indicate 
offers that either are not allowed or would cause you to lose
money).  Remember, try and buy at low prices and sell at high prices!
<p>
In the data displays, your information (e.g., transaction, values, etc.)
 is indicated by darkened squares.
<p>

.....Good luck!

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about this experiment:
</h3>

<b> Q: Who or what is controlling the other players in the experiment? </b>
<p>
Each player in the experiment is controlled by a simple adaptive 
algorithm that uses both the player's Buyer Value (or Seller Cost) and
some information that is available to everyone in the market to create
new offers.  Please note that, like you, these players only know
their own information, and the information that is being displayed at
the time.  (Thus, for example, they do not know the form of the
supply and demand curves, etc.)
<p>
<b> Q: How do the players take turns?
</b>
<p>
Buyers and sellers are 
randomly chosen to make offers to buy and sell.  
<p>
<b> Q: What is the graph that gets displayed at the end of the
trading session?
</b>
<p>
This graph gives the supply curve (in red) and demand curve (in blue)
for the market based on the Buyer Values and Supply Costs (displayed
in the upper-left) of all of the players in the market.  The time series
of actual trade prices is given by the magenta line (the square on
this line indicates your trade, if any).
<p>
<b>
Q: What do "Basic Market Statistics" tell me?
</b>
<p>
The basic market statistics (displayed at the end of the 
session in the upper-right panel) provide a variety of 
information.  
<ul>
<li> Competitive equilibrium price and quantity:
these are the price and quantity predictions 
for the market based on competitive equilibrium
theory (basically, that the market will equilibrate at a price
where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded---this point
occurs where the supply and demand curves intersect).
<li> Average (Std Dev) of price: this is the average (and standard
deviation in parentheses) of the transaction prices that occured
in the market.
<li> Quantity traded: the number of transactions that occured in the market.
<li> Maximum surplus: this is the maximum amount of total profit available
in the entire market place, assuming buyers and sellers are optimally
arranged.  
<li> Realized surplus: this is the amount of total profit actually
earned by the buyers and sellers who made trades in the market.
<li> Efficiency: This is the proportion of maximum profit realized by
the actual traders (that is, it is equal to (realized surplus)/(maximum surplus)).
Note that as efficiency gets closer to 1.0, the traders are realizing more
of the potential profits.
<li> Your trading efficiency: this is a measure of how well you
did trading in the market.  It is found by taking your actual profits and
dividing them by your expected profits if you traded at the competitive 
equilibrium price.  Thus, if this value is over 1.0 you did better than
expected, if it is below 1.0 you did worse than if you traded at
the equilibrium price.
</ul>

<b>
Q: What am I suppose to learn from all of this?
</b>
<p>
There are a variety of important lessons one can learn from this
experiment.  
<p>
First, it shows how a simple market operates.  Markets
similar to this one are responsible for allowing the exchange of
an enormous amount of the world's goods and services (in fact,
almost all goods and services available have been traded at one time or another by
similar markets).  
<p>
Second, it demonstrates how a simple market allows
a decentralized group to effectively exchange goods: there
was no central authority regulating who could trade with whom, 
very little information was being transmitted (only the bids and
asks of the various players), and each player was trying to do 
the best they could in the market, without being forced to trade.
Also, note that the transaction prices were not dictated, but 
simply emerged from the actions of the individual players.
Given these conditions it is always surprising that the market
is able to get most of the gains from trade (maximum profit) from
the players (how high was your market's efficiency?).
<p> 
<p>
Finally, it shows how competitive equilibrium theory can
accurately predict the outcome of such markets.  For most of these
markets, the competitive equilibrium theory does very
well at predicting the observed data.  (If you look at the graph,
the magenta line typically heads for the intersection of the supply and 
demand curves.)  Again, it is remarkable that in a world in
which individual players have so little information and 
no central authority is around to impose prices or trades on the players, 
that, nonetheless, the simple actions of the players create an aggregate
behavior that looks as if the players knew the actual
supply and demand conditions ahead of time.

Q: This stuff is great!  I would like to learn more about the
science behind all of this, what should I do?
</b>
<p>
We have developed a book that develops these ideas using
similar experiments to the one here.  If you want to learn
more, check out

Q: Something funny happens when I do X, why?

<p>
Hmmmm....send email to miller@zia.hss.cmu.edu, and I will look into it.
