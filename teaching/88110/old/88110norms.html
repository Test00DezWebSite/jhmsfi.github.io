73/88-110 Performance Chart Information, 1997
</h1>
<hr>

Here are the important statistics for plotting your performance
on the charts you were given at the beginning of the semester.
Please use this information wisely---if you find yourself getting
into trouble, seek help now.
<p>
The <strong>normalized score</strong>, which is what you plot in the charts,
is obtained by using the following equation:  Normalized_Score = (Your_Score
- Average) / Standard_Deviation.  For each chart, plot your normalized score and
connect neighboring dots.  (For plotting, the location on the X-axis is the
assignment, and the Y-Axis gives the normalized score.)  From this information
you should be able to easily spot trends.  Are your normalized scores consistently
good or bad?  Are they tending to move up or down over time?  Do they jump around
a lot?
