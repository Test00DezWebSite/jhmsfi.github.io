Special notes for assingment 4.1

The buyer values were: 44,43,42,...,32,31,30

The seller costs were: 30,31,32,...,42,43,44

Since we altered the experimental procedure, please note the
following changes to the assingment:

1) Begin your lab report with the second question on page
68 (thus, you do not have to answer the questions on 65-67).

2) We did not actually run the experiment needed for the first question 
on page 72.  Therefore when you answer this question give your best guess
about what would have happened if we had run the experiment where sellers
could talk about the price they wanted to set before hand, but would 
NOT share any of the profits in the actual market.
