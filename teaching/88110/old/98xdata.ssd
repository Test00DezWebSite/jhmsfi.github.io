Experiment 2: Shifting Supply Curves

The experiment was conducted on 11 September, 1998, at
Carnegie Mellon University by John H. Miller.

Here are some important notes:

Question 2, p 81: Assume that "mad cow disease" does not affect
seller costs.
 
Question 2, p 82, line 2: Removing the word "former" may relive
a potential ambiguity.
 
Questions 1 and 2, p 88: The first equation in each question
gives the supply curve (not the demand curve as stated), and 
the second equation gives the demand curve (not the supply curve).


Here is the data:
