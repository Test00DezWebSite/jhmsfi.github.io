Here is a type of question that you will definitely see on the exam.
To be ready, take any of these questions and just alter the conditions
(let things happen to buyers rather than sellers, make up new events
that will have the same and also opposite impact, etc.).

For each of the following situations, make a prediction about
what will happen to the equilibrium price and quantity in the market
after the policy is invoked.  Assume ``normal looking'' supply and 
demand curves, and straight-forward effects. (It will be very helpful 
if you sketch a supply and demand diagram for each situation.)
