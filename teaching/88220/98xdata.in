Experiment 11: Adverse Selection

The experiment was conducted on 4 November, 1998, at 
Carnegie Mellon University.

First, thanks to everyone who participated.  I know the lack
of power and sitting in the hallway was a drag, but I really do
appreciate all 58 of you who persevered.

Important Notes:

Use the data from the last round of each session for the Lab Report.
