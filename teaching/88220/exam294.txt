[5] Draw something interesting in the space below:




Part I: Quickies

I-1. Charles has the following set of indifference curves between
music and flowers (higher levels of utility are indicated 
by higher numbers), and faces either budget constraint $B_1$ or
$B_2$:


(see drawing given in class)
                                 
I-1.a. [5] Under $B_1$ what bundle will be chosen (label this point in
the diagram with a $1$)?

I-1.b. [5] Under $B_2$ what bundle will be chosen (label this point in
the diagram with a $2$)?

I-1.c. [5] Are the above preferences well-behaved (why or why not)?



I-2. Use the following diagram for these questions:

(see drawing given in class)


I-2.a. [10] In the above diagram, draw a set of indifference curves such that
the individual likes parks but doesn't care about swimming pools?

I-2.b. [5] Suppose parks cost \$5,000 to build, and swimming pools cost
only \$1,000 each.  If this person has \$100,000 to spend, what bundle
will she choose?

I-2.c. [5] What is unusual about this person's MRS at her optimal choice?




I-3. Consider the market for dogs and cats, and suppose that the 
price of dogs is \$5 and the price of cats is \$1.  

[10] Suppose that an individual enters the market with 5 dogs
and 10 cats.  Draw this individual's budget set.


(see drawing given in class)



I-4. 
There are a number of goods in the world where the quantity demanded
of the good is {\it not} very responsive to price, and yet
they are priced at low levels (e.g., drinking water, addictive
drugs, etc.).  

[10] 
Why does the price of these goods stay so low?

I-5. 
There are two goods, books and movies, both priced at
\$1 each.  Suppose that an individual initially has \$20 in
income. 


I-5.a. [5] 
Suppose that income goes up to \$30 and the price of
movies increases to \$2. What can you say about the change
in this individual's welfare caused by the price and income 
change?

I-5.b. [5] 
Suppose that under the initial price and income conditions
you also know that the individual was consuming 10 movies and 10 books.
What can you say about the change
in this individual's welfare caused by the price and income 
change that occurred in the previous question?


I-6. Some questions about taxes and subsidies:

I-6.a. [5] In general, do subsidies cause economic inefficiency?
Why or why not?

I-6.b. [5]
Under what two conditions will sellers best be able to pass on a tax?

I-6.c. [5]
Under what two conditions will a tax {\it not} lower economic efficiency?




I-7. Currently, CMU will place students on a waiting list when a course
fills to capacity.  

I-7.a. [5] Is this Pareto efficient? Why or why not?

I-7.b. [5] 
Suppose a waiting list has already been created. 
Suggest a new policy that would improve Pareto efficiency.


Part II: Longer Problems


II-1. 
Below are the demand functions for kids and adults for
milk.

(see drawing given in class)


[5] Using this information plot the market demand function.

[5] Suppose it is currently the case that only half the kids
are drinking milk.  Draw a feasible supply curve (that is responsive
to price) in the diagram
above that is consistent with this scenario, and label the
equilibrium price ($P^*$) and quantity ($Q^*$).

The government is concerned with the fact that not all kids
are consuming milk, and has decided to subsidize the drinking of
milk by everyone to the point where all kids will be drinking milk
(i.e., you consume a glass of milk, the government will pay you
\$$s$).  

[5] In the market diagram above indicate the size of the subsidy needed
to achieve this outcome (label it $s$).

[5] Label the new price paid by the buyers ($P_d$) and received
by the sellers ($P_s$) in the diagram.

[5] Provide a sound economic reason for {\it not} implementing
this policy.  (Hint:  Think about a less expensive way to structure
the subsidy and still achieve
the same ends.)



II-2.
A set of preferences is said to be quasilinear when the indifference
curves are just vertically shifted versions of one another (that is,
you take one indifference curve and then move every point upward by
the same amount to get a new indifference curve).

(see drawing given in class)

[10] Since quasilinear indifference curves are simply vertical
copies of one another, what must be true about the slope of
each indifference curve at a fixed level of $x$? (Hint: draw
a vertical line in the diagram above, and think about the slope
at each point where the line intersects the indifference curves.)

[5] Now, thinking carefully about your answers to the above, what will
the income consumption curves look like in this diagram?  Why? 

[5] How will changes
in income effect the demand for good $x$ (i.e., what do the Engle
curves look like)?


II-3. 
Consider the market for heroin (a highly addictive narcotic).  
Assume that quantity
demanded is completely unresponsive to price changes (due to addiction).

[5] In the diagram below, draw a representative set of supply and
demand curves assuming heroin use was {\it legal}.  Label the
equilibrium price ($P^*$) and quantity ($Q^*$).


[5] If we outlaw all heroin trades, will the resulting market be Pareto
efficient?  Why or why not?


[5] Provide a simple argument as to why we might see an illegal
market form under this policy?


[10] 
Suppose that we impose a policy that makes the selling of heroin
illegal (but not the consumption), and if you are caught selling, you will
pay a penalty. Using the
diagram above, graph the new supply and demand conditions in this market
and label the equilibrium price ($P^\prime$) and quantity ($Q^\prime$).

[5] 
Give a cogent economic argument for legalizing this market.


II-4. 
CMU is concerned with the fact that many incoming students do not
have proper access to the electronic media necessary to do well at
the university.
Suppose CMU forces all students to spend \$500 on a ``communications
terminal'' when they enroll in school.  This communications terminal
is at least as good as any other system available for \$500 or less. 
Students are allowed to buy a better computer if they wish, but
if they do so, their communications terminal is of no use, and
it will be sold for \$250 on the used terminal market.  (Thus, if
you want to buy a better computer you will have to sacrifice 
\$250 (which is equal to the \$500 you originally spent on the
terminal less the \$250 you received when you sold it back) and
then pay at least \$500 on a new computer.)

[10] In the diagram below, plot the budget constraint facing a
CMU student with an income of \$2000. Clearly label all significant
quantities and dollar amounts.


[5] In the above diagram draw a well-behaved indifference curve that
would indicate the student will only have the terminal (label 
this curve $I_t$).

[5] In the above diagram draw a well-behaved indifference curve that
would indicate the student will buy a better computer (label 
this curve $I_b$).

[5] Suggest an alternative policy that will make students at least
as well off, and justify your answer.
