MIDTERM GRADE INFORMATION:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: 

Friends, 

The midterm grade is designed to give you information.  The letter
grade you receive only indicates how you are doing relative to
your classmates.  If you get an A, you are doing much better
than average, a B indicates above average, a C indicates average
or slightly below, a D indicates below average, and an R indicates
much worse than average.  

When final grades are calculated, much more consideration will be 
placed on first trying to place each student within a group 
that deserves a similar grade, then trying to make
the best case for each student to have him or her moved to a higher
category based on unusual external circumstances, and finally assigning
grades appropriate to each group of students.  It is likely 
that such a process, if it were done today, would not result in anyone
receiving a lower grade than indicated, and might well allow some to
receive a higher grade.  

NOTWITHSTANDING THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE, DO NOT
IGNORE THE INFORMATION INHERENT IN YOUR MIDTERM GRADE!

If you received a D or R at midterm, you are in SERIOUS trouble,
and you need to do something about it NOW.  I am very willing to
help in any way that I can, but YOU need to take responsibility for
initiating and following up on actions that will better your grade.
COME AND SEE ME, NOW!  

If you are getting a C, you should also come and see me, as many 
such students, if they so desire, have been able to alter a few
behaviors and consequently learn and understand the material in
such a way that they can achieve much higher grades by the end
of the semester, if they initiate some action now.

If you are getting a B, good job, make a few adjustments and
strive for an A.  Come and see me if you want some suggestions. 

If you are getting an A, then please continue the fine work, and
also consider volunteering to help some of your other classmates
achieve a better understanding of the material.  This only takes a
small commitment of time (say one or two hours a week), and in the
process you will often learn a lot more about the material---teaching
is an easy route to learning.

What graded material is left in the semester:

Homework will constitute 30% of your final grade.  We have
done about 1/3 to 1/2 of all the homework assignments, thus
you have about 15-20% of your final grade remaining in homework.

The first midterm counted for 20% of your grade.  The second
midterm and the final count 20% and 30% respectively, thus
you have 50% of your grade left in this category.

To recap, there is roughly:

20% of the grade left on homework, and
50% remaining on exams (the next midterm is 25 October).

-----------------------------------------------------------
Your midterm grade was calculated as follows:

1) Each of your homework scores was first transformed by doing
the following:

   If you received a 0, you got a 0.0.
   If you received a 1, you got a 1.5.
   If you received a 2, you got a 2.0.
   If you received a 3, you got a 2.5.

This transformation allows us to truly differentiate those
who didn't hand in homework from those who did, and it also
allows someone who gets all 2's on the homework to still
get an A at midterm if otherwise deserving.

2) A final homework score was calculated by taking the sum of your 
transformed scores on the four homeworks (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.2)
and multiplying this sum by 10.  (Thus, if you received a 3 on
each of your homeworks, you would get 
  2.5 (transformed_score) x 4 (number_of_homeworks) x 10 = 100 points.

Obviously, final homework scores ranged from 0 to 100.

3)  Your midterm score was then calculated by adding your
final homework score to your midterm exam score.  

Thus, your midterm score is 66% from the exam and 33% from
the homework.  This is a relatively accurate reflection
of the final proportions (see above for what is left to
be graded).
