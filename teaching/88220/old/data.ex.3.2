Data from experiment 3.2, conducted 13 September, 1995

For the home work, note that we did not run the first session (the
one without a price ceiling).  Thus, answer all questions just using
the two sessions that we ran.  Note that when you plot the supply and
demand curves, the market with the price ceiling at 42 should 
emulate this first market (why?).

For both markets, buyer values ranged from 48-27,
and seller costs ranged from 47-26.
