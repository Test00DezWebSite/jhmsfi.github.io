Friends,

Here is the data for Experiment 1: Supply and Demand.

Note that we only ran one round of each session (normally,
we would have run two rounds of each session).  Some of
the questions in the lab report and homework ask about
the last round.  For any of these questions, just use 
the data for the first round (which is, of course, both
the first and last round in the session).  A few questions
ask you to compare what happened in the first round to what
happened in the last round---just ignore these.  

Also, for some conditions, equilibrium prices are a range of values.
You should clearly indicate that this is the case, but then only use
the midpoint of these values when you go about calculating profits, etc.
