MIDTERM GRADE INFORMATION, FALL 96:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: 

Friends, 

The midterm grade is designed to give you information.  The letter
grade you receive only indicates how you are doing relative to
your classmates.  If you get an A, you are doing much better
than average, a B indicates above average, a C indicates average
or slightly below, a D indicates below average, and an R indicates
much worse than average.  

When final grades are calculated, much more consideration will be 
placed on first trying to place each student within a group 
that deserves a similar grade, then trying to make
the best case for each student to have him or her moved to a higher
category based on unusual external circumstances, and finally assigning
grades appropriate to each group of students.  It is likely 
that such a process, if it were done today, would not result in anyone
receiving a lower grade than indicated, and might well allow some to
receive a higher grade.  

NOTWITHSTANDING THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE, DO NOT
IGNORE THE INFORMATION INHERENT IN YOUR MIDTERM GRADE!

If you received a D or R at midterm, you are in SERIOUS trouble,
and you need to do something about it NOW.  I am very willing to
help in any way that I can, but YOU need to take responsibility for
initiating and following up on actions that will better your grade.
COME AND SEE ME, NOW!  

If you are getting a C, you should also come and see me, as many 
such students, if they so desire, have been able to alter a few
behaviors and consequently learn and understand the material in
such a way that they can achieve much higher grades by the end
of the semester, if they initiate some action now.

If you are getting a B, good job, make a few adjustments and
strive for an A.  Come and see me if you want some suggestions. 

If you are getting an A, then please continue the fine work, and
also consider volunteering to help some of your other classmates
achieve a better understanding of the material.  This only takes a
small commitment of time (say one or two hours a week), and in the
process you will often learn a lot more about the material---teaching
is an easy route to learning.

What graded material is left in the semester:

Homework constitutes 40% of your final grade.  We have
done about 1/2 (actually a little less) of all the homework assignments, thus
you have about 20% of your final grade remaining in homework.

The first midterm counted for 20% of your grade.  The second
midterm and the final count 20% each, thus
you have 40% of your grade left in this category.

To re cap, there is roughly:

20% of the grade left on homework, and
40% remaining on exams (the next midterm is 23 October).

How was the midterm grade calculated?

Your midterm grade was calculated as follows:

1) Your score on the last homework (minimum wage) was multiplied by 1.2
so that the maximum points available were 12 instead of 10.

2) If you had any missing homework, you received a 0 on that homework.
You should double check with us if you think we may have inadvertently 
missed one of your homeworks (we will also try and send out notices to
those of you with missing grades, but it is still your responsibility to
check---Brian will be happy to check your information by request).

3) A midsemester_homework_score was calculated by taking the sum of your 
points on the four homeworks.  Thus, midsemester_homework_scores ranged 
from 0 to 48 points.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Although we will drop your lowest homework score in calculating
your final grade, we did not do this for midsemester, as we felt that
keeping it in provides some useful information.  
If you failed to turn in an assignment, the 0 you received
will have a big impact on your midsemester_homework_score---please make sure that you
turn in EVERYTHING else on time, so that this effect will be mitigated.

3)  Your midsemester_test_score was calculated by taking your
score on the first midterm and dividing it by 4.  Thus, 
midsemester_test_scores ranged from 0 to 50.

4) Your final_midsemester_score was calculated as follows:

final_midsemester_score = midsemester_homework_score + midsemester_test_score + 2

Thus, these scores ranged from 0 to 100, and are composed of roughly
50% from homework and 50% from exams.  (The final grade will be 40% and 60%
respectively.)
 
5) Your midsemester letter grade was calculated as follows:

A    >= 90
B    >= 80
C    >= 70
D    >= 60
R    < 60

Again, these grades are for your information, and do not reflect
what your actual letter grade would be if these were final grades.
(As a rough guide, reduce all of the above cutoffs by 3 points.)
