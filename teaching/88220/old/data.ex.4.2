Here is the data for experiment 4.2, Externalities.
Conducted in class on 13 November, 1995.

********IMPORTANT NOTE***********************
In the write-up for this lab there are some mistakes
in the booklet.  The book refers to an externality charge
of $0.50 and, on occasion, $1.00!  Please alter all of
these references to the $0.30 charge we used in the class.

Thanks
*****************************************************

In each market there were a total of 30 buyers and sellers.
Every time a sale occurred, a $0.30 cost was incurred by
every buyer and seller in the market (all 30 participants)
regardless of whether or not they were directly involved
in the transaction.

In each market the buyer values went from 51,50,...,38,37
and the seller costs went from 37,38,...,50,51
