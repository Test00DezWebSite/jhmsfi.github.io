88-220 Grading Requirements
</h1>
<hr>

Your final grade will be based on:

<p>
<ol>
<li> <strong> Homework (40%): </strong>
Homework will consist of laboratory reports from the 
<cite> Experiments in the Principles of Economics</cite>
book.  Note that these exercises are based on the results of
in-class experiments.  Due dates will be announced
in class, but there will be approximately 8-10 such homeworks.  
In calculating your final homework score we will eliminate the lowest
score received on one of your homeworks.
If needed, additional homework may be assigned.

<p>
<li> <strong> First (20%), Second (20%), and Third (20%) Exams:</strong>
These three exams will follow natural transitions in the lecture
material, and will promote understanding of the various topics.
The third exam will comprehensively cover all of the material in the course.
