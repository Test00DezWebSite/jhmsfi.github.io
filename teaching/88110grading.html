73/88-110 Grading Requirements, 2003
</h1>
<hr>

Your final grade will be based on:

<p>
<ol>
<li> <strong> Lab Reports and Homework (50%): </strong>
Homework will consist of lab reports and homework sections from the 
<cite> <a href="../eep/eep.html"> Experiments
with Economic Principles </a> </cite>
book or EconU.com.  The questions will require various skills, including in-depth 
analysis of experimental data, abstract thinking about general concepts, 
and the ability to connect the material to current events.  
Note that these exercises are based on the results of
class experiments, so you will need to be participate in these
experiments to do well on this work. Due dates will be announced
in class.  In calculating your final homework score we will 
eliminate the lowest score received on one of your homeworks. 
If needed, additional homework may be assigned.
<p>
<cite>Please Note: Averages on homeworks are typically
very high, so please compare your performance with the 
<a href="88110norms.html">performance chart data</a>
to get a good sense of your relative homework performance---it is
your relative performance on homework that will be factored into your final grade.</cite>

<p>
<li> <strong> Exams (40%):</strong>
There will be two exams,
both worth 20% of the final grade.
The exams will follow natural transitions in the lecture material and
are designed to provide continuity across the material and to 
insure that you keep the 
broader implications of what you are learning in mind. 

<p>
<li> <strong> Experimental Payoffs (10%): </strong>
Experimental payoffs accrue to you during the course of an
experiment, and are determined by your skill at meeting the 
predefined experimental goals.  We hope that your grade in 
this area will give you enough incentive to 
think carefully about your actions, but not so much as to 
diminish your enjoyment of the experience.  
Only students who fail to prepare for, or come to, the experiments
will be adversely impacted by this element of the grade.



</ol>
