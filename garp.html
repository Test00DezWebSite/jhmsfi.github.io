<h2> An Experimental Study of Rationality and Altruism </h2>

<bold> ABSTRACT: </bold>
Altruism and fairness are thought to be important in many 
economic situations.  
This paper 
asks whether altruistic choices can be captured in a simple neoclassical
framework with well-behaved preferences for giving.   We collect data 
with several different prices of altruism and verify that 96 
percent of subjects make choices that are consistent with the 
Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference.  
We estimate utility functions for subjects which could have 
generated the data, and then use these estimates 
to predict, successfully, data from outside our experiment. 
We argue that this neoclassical approach to a demand for altruism
can go a long way toward understanding
many anomalous results in economic laboratory experiments, and can 
provide an empirical foundation for theoretical models of a 
direct demand for giving.
