<h3>
2006 Graduate Workshop in Computational Social Science
</h3>
<h2>
Student Participants

<p>
This year we again had a large number of 
very well-focused, high quality applicants.
We inevitably end up being limited more by our capacity to 
effective work with the group than by the quality of the applicants.  
Over the past few years we have found that the workshop is much
more productive when we can identify students with interests that
easily overlap
with one another and the faculty.  If you did not get in to the
workshop, 
it was most likely because we were unable to identify this overlap, 
and not because we felt your skills or project had little potential.  
Please feel free to apply to next year's
workshop, and in the interim 
keep in touch with us and the web site.
