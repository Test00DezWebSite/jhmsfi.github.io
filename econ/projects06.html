<title> Student Projects, 2006 </title>

<h3> 2006 Graduate Workshop in Complexity and Computational Social Science</h3>

<h2> Student Projects </h2>

<hr> <hr> <p> Each student began a research project during the two-week
workshop.  Below are brief descriptions of these various projects.
These projects will form the basis for dissertation chapters and/or
journal articles.

<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Nils Bertshinger, Complex Systems, Leipzig (bertschi@mis.mpg.de).
</h4>
Nils considers the issue of information gained while sampling a search
space.  Using NK landscapes as the underlying search space, he derived
a mutual information measure that captured the additional information needed
to find the optimum.  Using this procedure he analyzed the performance
of learning algorithms across different spaces.  He also applied the idea to
understand better the impact of modularity in function optimization 
and learnability.


<p> <hr> <p> <h4>
Aaron Bramson, Political Science, U. of Michigan (bramson@umich.edu).
</h4>
Aaron is investigating the impact of neutral mutation networks on social science.
In many social situations, different behaviors can lead to very similar rewards,
for example, shaking hands or bowing as a way to greet one another.  Such neutral mutations may
allow diversity and divergence to flourish within a social system.  Using
a computational model, he is studying the development of cultural 
and moral systems.


<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Michael Findley, Political Science, U. of Illinois at U-C (mfindley@uiuc.edu).
</h4>
Michael is interested in the resolution of civil wars, in particular, how do negotiation
and implementation processes lead to stable resolutions that can avoid being "spoiled." 
The model has groups, with varying capabilities and
resolve, attempting to create a lasting peace settlement in an environment confounded with
random shocks.  He finds that as agents alter their discount rates the system can
exhibit very different behavior.  Moreover, subtle changes in belief updating can
result in large changes in system behavior.


<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Martin Ganco, Business Administration, U. of Illinois at U-C (mganco2@uiuc.edu).
</h4>
Martin employs a NKC model to understand better industrial dynamics.
There are very distinct patterns of firm performance in new industries, 
for example, preexisting (diversifying) firms behave quite differently than 
start ups in terms of entry timing and market share trends.  He assumes that
firms can be described as a set of coupled bit strings and uses a NKC model
to tie firm choices to market outcomes.  He finds that while firms with more internal
epistasis tend to be at a disadvantage early on in the evolution of an industry, they often attain a distinct advantage in later stages.  


<p> <hr> <p> <h4>  
Simone Giansante, Computational Finance, U. of Essex (sgians@essex.ac.uk).
</h4>
Simone's work focuses on the development of trading networks in a simple model of 
exchange based on Wicksell's triangle.  Agents must learn about what goods to offer and
accept from one another during bilateral trades that take place within networks of
trading partners.  If the network is fully connected, a single good emerges as the
medium of exchange.  As connectivity decreases, the medium of exchange alternates
across epochs.  At extremely low levels of connectivity, more than one medium of 
exchange can exist simultaneously.  When agents are allowed to reconfigure their
links to other traders, he finds that the networks tend toward characteristic
configurations where the majority of agents have only a few linkages to
others while a few agents become quite connected.


<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Stephen Haptonstahl, Political Science, Washington U. (srhapton@wustl.edu).
</h4>
Stephen is analyzing how communication can enhance group coordination.  
He uses an abstract model that allows information-processing agents to
learn how to send and receive tokens that have no a priori 
meaning.  Agents play a N-player Battle of the Sexes game where, while
they prefer to coordinate with one another, each has a favored coordination
point.  Preliminary results indicate that this framework can begin to
explain how communication can lead to coordination in groups, even when
such coordination is difficult due to agent incentives and a challenging 
external environment.


<p> <hr> <p> <h4>
Dominic Rohner, Economics, Cambridge (dr296@cam.ac.uk).
</h4>
Dominic wants to understand the interaction of information, reputation, and 
ethnic conflict through the use of an analytic game theory model.
In the model, agents interact with one another and attempt to trade.  
If an agents violates the terms of trade conflict ensues and reputations are
altered via social networks linked to the underlying ethnic groups.  
He finds that this reputation-based view is able to link the onset
of conflict to ethnic polarization, fractionalization, and
segregation.


<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Mary Shenk, Anthropology, U. North Carolina (mshenk@unc.edu).
</h4>
Mary is modeling marriage markets in South Asia.  Of particular interest is 
the recent rapid increase in dowry payments that has been observed in 
India and Bangladesh.  Her model incorporates parental choices for son's 
education and wealth
and daughter's dowry based on the parent's own wealth and education level.  
Children, after being endowed by their parents,
enter a marriage market and are matched based on their qualities.
She finds that small increases in the rate of return to wealth can 
lead to rapid booms in dowry payments.

<p> <hr> <p> <h4>
Hye-Jin Youn, Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (visang@gmail.com).
</h4>
Hye-Jin is exploring how cooperation can emerge in a growing population of
agents playing the Prisoner's Dilemma.
Incoming agents adopt the strategy
of the fittest agent in the population and link to that agent and one 
other, randomly chosen, 
agent.  In such a model, entering agents begin to adopt cooperative behavior at a very
rapid pace (this result holds even if there is a small chance of strategic mutation).  However,  this system is extremely sensitive to migration (re-wiring),
and defection can overwhelm the
system.

<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Rimma Yusim, Economics, Brandeis U. (yusim@brandeis.edu). 
</h4>
Rimma is interested in understanding issues surrounding the emergence of firms, 
especially the driving forces behind the distribution of firm size observed
across many economies.  
She assumes that firms face increasing returns to scale while workers must decide on
how much effort to offer to the firm---workers find it easier to shirk in larger
firms.  Finally, she allowed hiring to be influenced by friendship networks.
She finds that the average worker effort level in the population is stable, though
the effort in the largest firms is quite variable.  She also finds that 
aggregate patterns of industrial activity differ from models that
do not consider networks in important ways.
