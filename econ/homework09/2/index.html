<center> <h1> Squashing the Ponzi Bubble </h1> </center>

<center><h2> Miriam Reed and Matt Zimmerman</h2> </center>

<h2>1. Motivation</h2>

<p>Our primary motivation was the regulation strategy imposed in the
United States following the Savings &amp; Loans crash of the 1980s.
Regulators like William Black restricted growth of investment funds to
100%, and reportedly managed to pop the bubbles of several Ponzi
schemes before they grew to substantial dimensions (mostly within their
first one or two years). </p><p>A secondary motivation was to see if a Ponzi scheme operator
imposing an internal limit on growth rate could prolong the life of the
Ponzi scheme. This is based on the observation that Bernie Madoff
apparently restricted entry into his particularly long-lived fund. In
this project we model the growth and death of a stylized Ponzi scheme,
defined for our purposes as a fraudulent investment system in which no
generation of wealth takes place, so that principal and interest
payments are financed out of the fund's total capital and hence depend
on the growth rate of new investment in the fund. We then limit the
growth of the Ponzi schemes to different rates to see how this
regulation influences the scheme's persistence. We found that growth
limits that weren't set low enough to collapse a scheme would prolong
its existence. </p><p>We were also interested in how different learning rules and
information networks on potential investors changed the regulatory
strategy. We found that they had negligible effect. However, different
investment strategies had an effect on the level of optimal growth
limits.
</p><h2>2. Model</h2>

<p>We create a multi-agent model where investors can take on binary
states (0 = not invested in the Ponzi scheme, 1 = invested in Ponzi).
We assume that all agents invest in the Ponzi scheme when they learn
about it from another agent. This assumption is based on standard
finance theory, which claims that investors that are homogeneous with
respect to risk aversion should generate equivalence of high risk /
high return assets and low risk / low return assets due to arbitrage.
With myopic investors, assets in fraudulent schemes should break out of
this equivalence by seemingly yielding high returns at low risk
(volatility). For example, Madoff reportedly paid out 10% interest with
hardly any variance or correlation with the market. We ignore different
classes of investors, such as secondary funds that channeled money to
the Ponzi scheme
</p><h3>Key parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>population size</li>
<li>network structure</li>
<li>investment per investor</li>
<li>disinvestment rate</li>
<li>promised interest rate</li>
<li>regulated growth cap</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. Outcomes</h2>

<p>We create four iterations of the model with different parameters.
Population size is fixed at 1000 potential investors, 10 of whom were
initial investors. Each investor had $1 to invest and the Ponzi scheme
promised a 10% return on investment every time step. Each iteration is
run with no limits to growth and growth caps of 50%, 15% and 10%. </p><p>In the first three iterations, the fund is set up as
distributing the promised 10% interest (which is treated as being
consumed by investors). The disinvestment rate is set to zero in the
first three iterations. These iterations differe in agents' learning
rules regarding the Ponzi scheme. In the first iteration, individuals
are randomly paired each time step; if one member of the pair is not an
investor and the other member is, the former invests in the Ponzi
scheme. In the second iteration, individuals are randomly paired six
times each time step and if any agent's partner is an investor, that
agent becomes an investor. In the third iteration, agents are connected
by a random network with average connectivity (k) of four. If any of
the agents' neighbors are investors, that agent becomes an investor. </p><p>The results of all three iterations are qualitatively similar
and represented in Figures 1-3. Investment in the Ponzi scheme follows
a traditional s-shaped diffusion curve, and eventually goes to
fixation. As expected, higher connectivity leads to faster growth.
Limiting the growth rate flattens the rate at which the Ponzi scheme
spreads, and significantly prolongs the survival time of the Ponzi
scheme but with little effect on the total capital bound up in the fund
over its lifetime. However, when the cap on the growth rate equals the
promised investment rate (here, 10%), then the scheme collapses early
without a large number of investors or funds. This result is robust for
different frequencies of pairings, different promised interest rates
(not reproduced here) and different values of average network
connectivity.

1. Individuals are randomly paired once each time step and learn about
the Ponzi scheme from their partners. Higher caps extend the length of
the scheme. However, a 10% cap, matching the promised investment rate
(the cyan line) prevents massive investment in the scheme before its
collapse.

2. Individuals are randomly paired six times each time step and learn
about the Ponzi scheme from any of their partners. Although investment
in the scheme spreads faster in the population, these results are
qualitatively similar to those in iteration 1.

3. Individuals associate over a network (mean k = 4) and learn about
the Ponzi scheme from their neighbors. Again, the results are
qualitatively similar to those in the first two iterations. <p>In the final iteration of our model, we explored the robustness of
our results to a reinvesting fund scheme, in which promised interest is
plowed back. In this case, the learning rules is identical to the
network association in the third iteration. With a fixed probability of
10% every time step an agent chooses to disinvest in the scheme,
withdrawing its principal and compound (imputed) interest. Agents may
decide to reinvest, but only their initial $1 principal. Due to the
effects of compound interest which increases the effective promised
per-time-step return, we expect that the regulatory cap needs to be set
at a somewhat higher level in order to collapse the scheme if the fund
runs a reinvesting strategy, compared to a disbursing fund. The model
confirms this expectations, as can be seen in the results in Figure 4.

4. Individuals associate over a network (mean k = 4) and learn about
the Ponzi scheme from their neighbors. The fund is reinvesting earned
interest, but investors randomly disinvest at a constant rate of 10%.
Caps at both 15% and 10% effectively regulate the Ponzi scheme's
growth.
<h2>4. Extensions</h2>

<p>Investment frauds are based on trust: Madoff was one of the most
respected actors on financial markets. Including trust in the model
might make the disinvestment schedule u-shaped, as distrust is high in
the initial phase, falls as reputation spreads, and then rises as the
fragility of the scheme becomes evident. Furthermore, in this case
payouts will not only reduce the fund's total capital, but also
increase confidence as neighbors observe the apparent stability and
trustworthiness of the fund.
</p><p>Heterogeneous agents with respect to risk aversion would allow
to depart from standard finance theory, with a distribution in
risk-return combinations between assets.
</p><h2>5. Other applications</h2>

<p>The salient feature of our model is the growth restriction, combined
with the death of the system due to the disinvestment rate.
One possible other application would be nuclear weapon agreements, in
which countries voluntarily restrict the growth of their armament (and
research), and in which the world could potentially become nuclear
weapons-free if countries decided to pull out of nuclear armament.
Another application would be vermin control, where only a limited
amount of rodenticide is brought out for animal rights reasons, and
birth control is applied instead.
