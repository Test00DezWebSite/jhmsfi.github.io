<h1>When Should Bernie Run?</h1>
<h2>Olivia Woolley and Davide Marchiori</h2>
<h2>GWCSSMC09 HW1: Weekend at Bernie's</h2>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Using an agent based model of a Ponzi scheme we explore how the ratio between the 
rate at which new individuals are recruited into the scheme and the rate at
which contracts expire and investors pull out their funds affects the lifetime of the scheme. We also investigate how the average number of neighbors
an agent has affects this lifetime. We find that as the ratio of termination
rate
to recruitment rate increases, the lifetime of the Ponzi scheme
decreases very quickly at first and then slowly. In the region where
schemes have a long lifetime they are longer lived when the number of
average neighbors is larger.  
</p>


<h2>2. The Model</h2>

<p>
We assume a fixed population size and density of agents. All agents are described by
their fixed coordinates on a plane, their state (either investing in the
scheme or not) and the ammount of wealth which they are willing to invest
(which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 100). 
</p>

<p>
Once agents switch to the investing state we assign to them the time at
which they will terminate their contract. We assume that at this time and
only at this time,
agents will pull out all of their investment and claim their interest
returns. Interest rates are assumed to have a fixed value, which we have
set to 50% for these simulations. In our framework, the Ponzi scheme will come to and end 
as soon as there are insufficient funds to fully pay the debt claimed by an
investor.
</p>

<p>
We we assume that all agents participating in the scheme will
actively recruit others. Thus, we assign to them the times at which
they will make these recruitment attempts. Any agents targeted who are not 
already investors will always join the scheme.
Agents recruit others within their neighborhood only. As shown in the figure
below, neighborhoods have a radius d 
chosen so that all agents will have a given average number of neighbors.

<p>
We assume that both recruitment 
times and termination times are random parameters distributed exponentially
throughout the population, with fixed rates. 
</p>

<h2>3. Results</h2>

<p>
We run simulations tuning the values of the parameters 
<i>radius size</i> 
and <i>terminationRate/recruitmentRate ratio</i>. For the first, we 
considered three values corresponding to different average numbers of 
neighbors (namely, 1, 5, and 10). For the second parameter we considered 
the following values: 0.001, 0.003, 0.005, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 
0.5, and 0.9. Because the model is stochastic, for each parameter configuration 
we averaged the time to collapse of the Ponzi scheme over 40 runs.
Looking at the figures below, the first thing that is worth noting is that 
the time to collapse is non-linearly decreasing in the 
<i>terminationRate/recruitmentRate ratio</i>. This result is rather 
intuitive: if we fix the average duration of contracts, then the 
higher the ability of the Ponzi to find people that want to invest, the higher the chances for the scheme 
to survive. Secondly, the size of the radius has an effect on the 
average time to collapse: for 
fixed values of the <i>terminationRate/recruitmentRate ratio</i>, the 
smaller the agent's neighborhoods, the shorter the time to collapse. This 
effect is larger for smaller values of the 
<i>terminationRate/recruitmentRate ratio</i>.

The figure above shows the lifetime (y axis) of the scheme corresponding to
different ratios (x axis). Below we show the same plot with a logarithmic
scale for lifetime.

scheme (y axis) vs number of iterations.
<h2>4. Further Research</h2>

<p>
Future research could focus on many open issues that can be grouped in four 
main categories.

<h3>4.1 Systematic exploration of parameter space</h3>
In our analysis we focused just on the relationship between the ratio 
terminationRate/recruitmentRate and neighborhood sizes. The values of all the other 
parameters are arbitrary. A systematic investigation of the parameter space would 
improve our understanding of the model and of the role played by each variable.


<h3>4.2 Make more realistic assumptions</h3>
In our model agents are not allowed to reinvest their money once the 
contract expires, although the fact that they are assigned different time to 
repayment might be interpreted in this sense. However, in order to 
increase the realism of the model, agents could be allowed to reinvest 
their money (perhaps with a different interest rate), and the probability 
of reinvestment defined as a function of neighbors' average behavior (i.e., 
the higher the number of its neighbors that decide to withdraw, the higher the 
probability that an agent will not reinvest).


<h3>4.3 Investigate the effects of agents' heterogeneity</h3>
It would be interesting to analyze the effect of agents' heterogeneity on 
the dynamics of our model. Heterogeneity could be introduced associating 
to agents different values for the radius (the bigger the radius, the more 
interconnected that agent), different interest rates, and different 
propensities to invest.


<h3>4.4 Model collapse dynamics</h3>
In our model we assumed that the Ponzi scheme collapses after the first 
default. This assumption could be seen as too simplistic. 
Indeed, it is reasonable and realistic to hypothesize a situation in 
which the Ponzi scheme is allowed to survive despite defaulting on some
repayments and we 
think that this would generate richer dynamics.
