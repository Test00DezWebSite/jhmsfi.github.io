<h2>I. Model Summary</h2>

The objective of our modeling approach was to generate predictions about the dynamics of investment 
and deinvestment in a fraudulent investment strategy with two classes of investors: speculators and
ordinary investors. The proprietor of the fraudulent investment firm (Bernie), speculators, and 
ordinary investors are modeled as interacting artificial agents with varying motivations and levels 
of information.  The interactions between investors are captured by an explicit network structure.  
Bernie offers a range of returns on investments that are perpetually
greater than or equal to market value, and potential investors must decide whether and how much to 
invest, while current investors must decide whether or not to withdraw funds.  Bernie pays the promised 
interest rate if funds are available, and a lesser amount if funds are not available.  When too many 
investors decide to exit the investment strategy, the scheme crashes.

<br><br>

<h2>II. Key Assumptions</h2>

<h3>II.a. Agents: Bernie, Speculators, Ordinary Investors</h3>

Speculators and Ordinary Investors have initial cash endowments drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 10,000.  
The sum of the endowments of all Speculators and Ordinary Investors make up the total money supply in the population.  

<h4>Bernie</h4>
<ul>
<li>Motivation is to maximize salary earned by keeping the investment scheme afloat for as long as possible</li>
<li>Pays the advertised level of interest if funds are available in the account</li>
<li>Pays the highest level of interest possible, after salary, if funds are not available in the account</li>
<li>Interest accrued is payed out at each period.  I.e., the investment scheme does not allow for increasing returns</li>
</ul>
<h4>Speculators</h4>
<ul>
<li>Attempt to maximize the returns on their investments by encouraging others to join and exiting the investment scheme prior to the crash</li>
<li>Signal to others with whom they have connections that the investment is providing higher returns than it actually is</li>
<li>In the first and second periods, invest a random proportion of their personal stock of funds</li>
<li>In later periods, if Bernie's total stock of investments falls below the level in the previous year, withdraw funds</li>
<li>Have full information about the total stock invested in the fund</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ordinary Investors</h4>
<ul>
<li>Form beliefs about the potential returns on investment through connections with others who are invested and their own previous returns, if any</li>
<li>Use beliefs to determine whether and how much to invest in the fund<br>
    Belief<sub>i</sub> = f(rate of investor neighbours<sub>i</sub>, Bernie's repayment history<sub>i</sub>)<br>
    If Bernie's interest rate > market interest rate + threshold of the agent (normally distributed)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invest<br>
    Else<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; withdraw all funds, if any<br>
    Amount of Investment<sub>i</sub> = f(stock of money<sub>i</sub>, belief<sub>i</sub>, interest rate)</li>
<li>Have no information about the total stock invested in the fund</li>
</ul>

<h3>II.b. Network Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Similar to a small world network, but number of connections is not the same for each agent</li>
<li>Allows for preferential attachment</li>
<li>Initial structure remains fixed throughout each simulation</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>III. Results</h2>

The above assumptions were used to simulate aggregate investor market behavior across a range of interest rates.  The following figure 
presents the results of investment and deinvestment of the pooled population of speculators and regular investors over the first twenty 
periods, across a discrete set of interest rate values.

The figure indicates a dynamics in which initial investment reaches its peak very quickly, and is followed by a period of deinvestment
where the the total stock of money invested in the fund becomes negligible within several periods.  Technically, a "crash" occurs when
total deposits dip below zero.  This only occurs at very low interest rates across the iterations, and at very high interest rates, but 
only for the last several iterations.

<br><br>

Disaggregating the population, the following figure depicts the same dynamics as above, but for the speculator class only.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>

Here we see a very different, cyclic pattern of investment and deinvestment.  After initially getting the ball rolling for the investment
scheme, and encouraging ordinary investors to join, speculators quickly begin to withdraw their funds, initially taking out more than 
they themselves put in.  This has the effect of making the ordinary investors the only agents in the population who remain invested.  Then
as speculators see that the investments made are as large as or larger than the previous year, they again throw their own funds into the
game.  This pattern then repeats itself in a cyclic fashion, but deinvestment is never as extreme as in the initial drop.

<br><br>

<h2>IV. Possible Extensions</h2>

A realistic feature in this type of investing that we did not include, but which could be added later, is to allow for increasing returns.
In such a scenario, investors would be allowed to leave accrued interest in the investment account, increasing the total account balance upon
which future interest is accrued.  Such a feature could potentially lead to larger and/or longer lasting bubbles.  Additional real-world 
features that could be included in future versions are larger numbers of wealthy and poor potential investors.  In the version presented above,
the total money supply is normally distributed, but we could use a distribution with fatter tails, or even a bimodal distribution to represent
more exaggerated levels of wealth inequality.  The distribution of wealth could also be assumed to be correlated with the type of agent.  Finally,
and we think most importantly, in future extensions we could allow for agent learning.  In the current framework Ordinary Investors and 
Speculators only have a memory of a single period.  And we do, in
fact, see investing in periods after the fund has crashed.  Building some feature about the investment fund's reputation into agent decision-making
would likely lead to more realistic dynamics.

<h2>V. Other Social Science Applications</h2>

Other potential social science applications include situations in which (i) an agent seeks to convince a population of other agents to pay some cost 
of support based on the promise of future returns, (ii) one class of agents in the population has some stake in convincing the others to offer that
support, and (iii) another class of agents is potentially willing to pay the cost of support in the hope of future returns.

<br><br>

One such situation could be the gain and loss of public support for elected officials.  In this situation, the public official would be the agent
attempting to convince the mass public to pay some cost of support (e.g., voting, foregoing a vote for someone else), and would do so by making
campaign promises in regard to particular policy areas.  Political activists would represent the class of the public with a stake in convincing
others in the population to offer that support.  The stake here may be in the form of a job in the official's administration, the potential financial
gain from a future government contract, etc.  Ordinary citizens would represent the class of the population that is potentially willing to offer
support, but expects to gain some sort of policy action in return.  When a public official is elected based on particular policy promises, and those
promises cannot be fulfilled, past supporters will pull their support.  At this point, the political activists may abandon their exaggerated 
support for this particular official.  The investment in this official's line of goods fails when she is thrown out of office.

Collective actions of a few big players and speculators can also create supernormal returns in the art market, in which winning bids in 
art auctions influence the value of all works of the artist. Particularly in the contemporary art market, it is argued that auctioneers, dealers 
and collectors who have large collections of an artist's works, work cooperatively in order to inflate the bids made in auctions. This mechanism can 
create a bubble that yields supernormal returns until the rise in the prices of artworks cannot be sustained.  In such a scenario, art dealers
would represent the agent attempting to convince a population to pay a cost of support; serious art collectors would represent those in the population
who have a stake in convincing others in the population to pay the cost of support; and ordinary art investors would be the potential investor class.
