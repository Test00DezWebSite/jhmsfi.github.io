<p>The applet requires Java 1.4.1 or higher.  It will not run on
Windows 95 or Mac OS 8 or 9.  Mac users must have OS X 10.2.6 or higher and use
a browser that supports Java 1.4.  (Safari works, IE does not.
Mac OS X comes with Safari. Open Safari and set it as your default
web browser under Safari/Preferences/General.)
On other operating systems, you may obtain the latest Java plugin from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/download.html">Sun's Java site</a>.</p>

<p><hr>

<p><font size="-1">In order for this to work, this file, your model file
(Pyramid Scheme.nlogo), and the file NetLogoLite.jar
must all be in the same directory.  (You can copy NetLogoLite.jar
from the directory where you installed NetLogo.)</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">On some systems, you can test the applet locally on your computer
before uploading it to a web server.  It doesn't work on all systems,
though, so if it doesn't work from your hard drive, please try
uploading it to a web server.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">You don't need to include everything in this file in your page.
If you want, you can just take the HTML code beginning with
&lt;applet&gt; and ending with &lt;/applet&gt;, and paste it into any HTML
file you want.  It's even OK to put multiple &lt;applet&gt; tags
on a single page.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">If NetLogoLite.jar and your model are in different
directories, you must modify the archive= and value= lines
in the HTML code to point to their actual locations.
(For example, if you have multiple applets in different
directories on the same web server, you may want to put 
a single copy of NetLogoLite.jar in one central place and
change the archive= lines of all the HTML files to point
to that one central copy.  This will save disk space for
you and download time for your users.)</font></p>
