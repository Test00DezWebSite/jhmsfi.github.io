<p><strong><font size="5">Problem</font></strong></p>
<p>A group of, say, ten students each need to give a five minute talk, one after 
  the other. The order of presentations is not specified. What happens?</p>
<p> Model, using whatever techniques you wish, the above scenario.</p>
<p> Explicitly state your model and key assumptions.<br>
  Summarize key results.<br>
  Suggest some potentially interesting future directions and questions for the 
  model. </p>
<p>Suggest some standard social science scenarios that could be usefully modeled 
  using such a process.</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">Model</font></strong></p>
<p>We viewed this problem as a one-sided matching problem; 10 presentation slots 
  needed to be filled by ten students. We assumed that students had preferences 
  over both the slot in which they presented and the presenter immediately preceding 
  them.</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">Student Types</font></strong></p>
<p>Our first assumption was that students have preferences over the order in which 
  they present. Some students might prefer going toward the beginning, others 
  prefer going somewhere in the middle, and some prefer going towards the end. 
  We represented these preferences by creating three types of agents.</p>
<p>1) Prefers going toward the beginning<br>
  2) Prefers going in the middle<br>
  3) Prefers going toward the end</p>
<p>The following table lists each student type's ranking of the possible presentation 
  slots, from most-preffered to least-preferred.</p>
<table width="47%" border="1">

<p><font size="5"><strong>Nemesis</strong></font></p>
<p>If these were the students' only preferences, then a random serial dictatorship 
  would produce an optimal allocation. The instructor randomly selects one student, 
  who chooses her most-preferred slot. Then the instructor randomly chooses another 
  student, who chooses his most-preferred slot from those remaining. This process 
  continues until all students have chosen.</p>
<p>However, we also assume that each student might have a &quot;nemesis&quot; 
  -- a student whom they don't want to immediately follow. It's easy to imagine, 
  for instance, that no one wants to present immediately after John Miller. We 
  assume that presenting immediately after your nemesis is the worst of all possibilities. 
  We examine five nemesis scenarios:</p>
<p>1) Each student has no nemesis<br>
  2) Each student has the same nemesis<br>
  3) Half the students have one nemesis, the other half have another<br>
  4) Each student's nemesis is the next student (e.g., 1 fears 2, 2 fears 3, ... 
  , 10 fears 1)<br>
  5) Each student's nemesis is chosen randomly</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">Random Serial Dictatorship</font></strong><br>
  <br>
  As mentioned above, the basic selection process is a random serial dictatorship. 
  We randomly choose a permutation of the students and allow them to pick their 
  most-preferred slots in that order.</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">Student Strategies</font></strong></p>
<p>Every time an agent chooses a slot, all the agents who have picked previously 
  have the option of abandoning their slots. We consider two different abandonment 
  strategies:</p>
<p>1) Abandon your slot if your nemesis has picked the slot immediately preceding 
  you.<br>
  2) Abandon your slot if a more preferred slot is empty or if your nemesis has 
  picked the slot immediately preceding you.</p>
<p>If a student abandons her slot she moves to the end of the choosing order and 
  chooses a new slot after all other students have chosen.</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">Student Scores</font></strong></p>
<p>Each student receives a score for the slot they have to present in. Students 
  receive a ten if they obtain their first preference, a one if their receive 
  their last preference, and a zero if their nemesis presents immediately before 
  them.</p>

  <strong><font size="5">Experiment</font></strong></p>
<p>The experiment proceeds as follows:</p>
<p>1) Randomly assign a type to each student<br>
  2) Randomly assign the order in which the students choose their slots<br>
  3) For each nemesis &amp; strategy scenario, repeat the following until all 
  agents have slots:<br>
  <br>
  a) Each agent chooses the remaining slot which is most preferred<br>
  b) After each selection, agents decide whether to abandon their slots</p>
<p>4) Calculate scores</p>
<p>This process was repeated for 10,000 simulations. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="graph3.jpg" width="492" height="288"><br>
  <br>
  Students who prefer going last are much more likely to end up presenting immediately 
  after their nemesis.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="5"><strong>Conclusions</strong></font></p>
<p> 1) Having a nemesis hurts you, and having the same nemesis as everyone else 
  hurts you even more.<br>
  2) With random preferences, most students get one of their top 4 choices.<br>
  3) Preferring to present early is a good way of avoiding your nemesis.<br>
  4) Choice of strategy had no significant effect on the student's scores.</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">Possible Extensions</font></strong></p>
<p>1) Multiple nemeses.<br>
  2) Two-sided nemises preferences -- agents don't want to present immediately 
  before or after nemesis<br>
  3) Less-restrictive preferences -- maybe an agent doesn't want to go first but 
  would like to go second.</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">Other Social Science Scenarios</font></strong></p>
<p>1) Housing allocation when you care about who your neighbor is. For example, 
  you might not want to live downwind from someone who never showers.<br>
  2) Seating in a full theatre. For example, you might not want to sit next to 
  someone who never showers.<br>
