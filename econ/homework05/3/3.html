<h1 style='margin-top:.25in'>The Problem:</h1>

<h1 style='margin-top:0in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Goudy Old Style";
font-weight:normal'>A group of, say, ten students each need to give a five
minute talk, one after the other. The order of presentations is not specified.
What happens? </span></h1>

<h1>Model development: </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>This task is composed of two sub-tasks:
the basic scheme or social norm used to order the talks, and a model of how the
students participate under these norms, influencing their position.  </p>

<h2>Group ordering mechanism: Any volunteers?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There are two general approaches
to the problem of ordering: One could define the order of all the talks using
various strategies <i>before</i> any were given.  The other approach affords an
emergent order.  Each student in turn is selected after the previous speaker
has finished, leaving the complete order undefined until the second-to-last
speaker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>We interpreted the homework problem
as prediction not of any general ordering task, but rather one specific to
students in a particular scenario (our own).  Without a strongly centralized
figure implied in the problem statement (and the workshop is about, amongst
other things, emergence after all), the emergent approach was selected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:13.5pt'>That said, then how was each
student to be chosen?  We  identified four possible mechanisms, loosely ordered
in decreasing constraint:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Consensus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Vote</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Pick someone to delegate who’s next</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Volunteer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Consensus in this scheme would
require all students to agree on who should go next, each round.  We felt that
this was a very unlikely mechanism for many reasons: To make informed choices,
students would need substantial a priori knowledge of their colleague’s talks.  Convergence
or consensus would be time and effort intensive.  There is also little
precedence for using such a mechanism.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><img width=164 height=224
src="3_files/image001.gif" align=right>One step back is the process of majority
vote: Students would be asked to say who’s next, but the decision would come
from a of majority votes rather than full agreement.  Though a voting mechanism
is reasonable, it still seemed to be a lot of overhead for the task at hand,
and outside the experience of either of the investigators in similar
applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Next to be considered is election
of a single entity who then would have the responsibility to choose the
speakers in order.  While this could be an excellent mechanism to order a
conference session, it did not seem to fit the nature of the workshop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><img width=138 height=239
src="3_files/image002.gif" align=left>Finally, a volunteer mechanism was
explored.  One of our key assumptions was that other students’ actions early in
the presentations should be able to influence later ordering and
presentations.  Given this feature, the nature of the homework problem, the
context of the workshop, and the lack of knowledge the participants had of each
other, volunteerism stood out as a feasible mechanism for further consideration. 
We assumed that a moderator could also participate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>From these notions a basic model
of voluntary speaker selection was developed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If only one volunteers, they go</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If more than one (“at bat” in simulation below)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Moderator chooses randomly amongst them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Continues until all volunteers get their turn</p>

<h2>Students’ influence the order: To choose when to volunteer</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Thus the actual selection mechanism
was modeled quite simply, but there was still the more complex issue of determining
if each of the students would volunteer in that turn.  Their decision could be
influenced by many considerations: a priori knowledge of speakers and/or their
topics, their interest in the quality and coherence of the whole session, a
desire to make their point understood, and simple intrinsic preferences to
presenting in a particular position (e.g. first, last, in the middle).  These
were captured in four dimensions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i>Topic closeness:</i> </b>were the previous speakers’ topics
closely related to mine?  Can I expect the remaining talks to me more or less
relevant to mine?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i>Presentation Quality:</i> </b>Were the previous
presentations much better than what I can do?  Will I look “good” or “bad”? On
the other hand, were they so bad that  the audience is exasperated, and I may
want to wait until the general quality improves (which I expect it to).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i>Slot:</i></b><i> </i>Is this opportunity near to where I
want to be in the order?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><i>Aversion to the “Pregnant Pause”:</i> </b>Has the amount of
time since the last volunteer exceeded my tolerance?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>For the purpose of this initial
simulation, student were randomly assigned  values representing personality
traits.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>The Simulation</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Students were modeled as agents,
each with a randomly assigned personality.  Each agent had their own image of
the personality traits of the other students.  These were either assumed to b random,
as if they had no a priori knowledge of the other students, or assigned the
actual average of the group, assuming some general knowledge of their peers.  
As the simulation progressed, each agent was able to establish the “true”
personality of previous speakers, and could infer  their own standing among the
remaining participants.  Once agents determined (based on their own personality
criteria and inferred traits of the other students) that the next opportunity
would be most advantageous compared to remaining turns, they volunteer. </p>

<h1>Simulation Results</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=576 height=388 src="3_files/image004.gif"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The graph shows data from the two
different a priori data made accessible to the agents.  Across ten runs, the
mean for <i>meanpop</i> was 3.9 with a variance of 1.4.  When the agents were
assigned a <i>random</i> guess of everyone else’s personality, the mean was 4.6
with a variance of 3.2.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The difference in variance is
likely explained by the random-guessers either over estimating the
topic-closeness or underestimating the quality of the remaining students.  </p>

</span></span>Dynamic adjustment  or learning – see below</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>To reduce the dimensionality of
the agent population, and to better represent qualities often encountered in
presenters, personality traits could be purposefully weighted, creating
distinct “personalities.”  For example, some students may just want to “get it
over with”.  They may only be concerned with <i>slot</i>, and would volunteer
first regardless of all other considerations.  Other students may be more
focused on influencing the audience and therefore being understood.  They would
be more inclined to be concerned with the grouping of like papers and the
appropriate order, e.g. I should follow Ms. X because that work is fundamental
to my own.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Finally, this study investigated
two different estimates of other student’s personalities.  An extension of the
concept of using a priori knowledge would be a learning mechanism, exploiting
past and present knowledge via learning algorithms that could provide better
estimates of the remaining student pool. </p>
