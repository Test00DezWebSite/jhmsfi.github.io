<strong> Abstract: </strong>
Simulation models are becoming increasingly
common in the analysis of critical scientific, policy, and management
issues.  Such models provide a way to analyze complex systems characterized
by both large parameter spaces and nonlinear interactions.  Unfortunately, these
same characteristics make understanding such models using
traditional testing techniques extremely
difficult.  Here we show how a model's structure and
robustness can be tested via a simple, automatic, nonlinear search
algorithm designed to actively ``break'' the model's implications.
Using the active nonlinear tests (ANTs) developed here, one can
easily probe for key weaknesses in a simulation's structure, and
thereby begin to improve and refine the model's design.
We demonstrate ANTs by testing a well-known model of global dynamics (World3),
and show how this technique can be used to uncover small, but powerful,
nonlinear effects that may highlight vulnerabilities in the 
original model.

<h3>
Evolving Information Processing
Organizations
</h3>

<strong>Date: </strong>

<strong> Keywords: </strong> Organizational Theory, 
Information Processing,
Coordination, Parallel Computing, and Genetic Algorithms.

<strong> Abstract: </strong>
The organization of information processing resources is a central question
in economic, organizational, and computational theory.  Recent work
by Radner (1992) and others 
has developed a simple theoretical framework and some
useful formal mathematical results about the behavior of such 
systems.
Here, we follow a complementary computational approach that allows us
to pursue questions concerning the impact of 
coordination and various exogenous conditions facing the organization.  
We find that organizations demonstrate ``order for free,'' that is,
given a simple structural framework and a set of standard 
operating procedures, even randomly 
generated organizations imply well-defined patterns
of behavior.  Using a genetic algorithm, we also show that simple
evolutionary processes allow organizations to ``learn'' better
structures.

<p>
<strong> Abstract: </strong>
We construct a computational
model of Tiebout competition and show that political institutions
differ in their ability to  sort citizens effectively.  In particular,
we find that certain types of institutions---those that become more
``political unstable'' as citizen heterogeneity increases---perform
relatively poorly given a single jurisdiction, yet these same 
institutions perform relatively well when there are multiple 
jurisdictions.  We provide an explanation for this phenomenon 
which draws upon simulated annealing, a discrete nonlinear search 
algorithm.

<strong> Abstract: </strong>
 
In democratic elections, parties tend to converge to similar positions
on  some issues while diverging on others. In this paper, we test a
theoretical model of two-party competition in which voters'
preferences determine an electoral landscape upon which adaptive parties choose
issue positions. The degree of party divergence depends on the
distribution of  voters' ideal points and on how voters assign
weights, or strengths, to policy dimensions.  The computational and
mathematical theory being tested suggests that the more
weight voters' assign to a policy dimension on which they have extreme
preferences, the more parties will separate on that policy.  Using
American National Election Studies data on American presidential
elections, we find robust empirical support for this hypothesis.

<h3>
Political Parties and Electoral Landscapes

<p>
<strong> Keywords: </strong> 
Spatial Voting, Voter Preferences, Adaptive Behavior and Bounded
Rationality.
<p>
<strong> Abstract: </strong>
We study the relationship between voters' preferences and the
emergence of party platforms in two-party democratic elections 
with adaptive parties.  In the model, preferences of voters and the
opposition party's platform determine an <em> electoral landscape </em>
on which the challenging party must adaptively search for votes.
We show that changes in the underlying distribution of voters' 
preferences result in different electoral landscapes which can be
characterized by a measure of <em> ruggedness</em>. 
We find that locally 
adapting parties converge to moderate platforms regardless of the 
landscape's ruggedness.  Greater ruggedness, however, tempers a
party's ability to find such platforms.  Thus, we are able to
establish a link between the distribution of voters' preferences and 
the responsiveness of adaptive parties.

<h3>
The Dynamics of Locally-Adaptive Parties 
under Spatial Voting
</h3>

<strong>Date: </strong> 
Revised 1 November, 1995.
<p>
<strong> Keywords: </strong> 
Spatial Voting, Dynamics, Local Adaptive Behavior and Bounded
Rationality.
<p>
<strong> Abstract: </strong>
We explore the dynamics of a model of two-party 
competition under spatial voting.  The parties are allowed to 
<em> incrementally </em> adapt their platforms by following the voting
gradient imposed by the preferences of the electorate and platform
of the opposition.  
The emphasis in this model is on the
dynamic system formed by these conditions, in particular, we
examine the characteristics of the transient paths and the
convergence points of the evolving platforms.
We find that in a simple spatial model with probabilistic
voting, regardless of
the initial platforms
of each party, platforms  eventually converge to a unique,
globally stable equilibrium matching the strength-weighted mean
of the voters' preferred positions.  This result holds even if
we allow simple cross-issue weightings, however, if we
allow nonlinear weighting
functions many dynamic possibilities occur, including multiple
equilibria and, perhaps, limit cycles.

<h3>
The Coevolution of Automata in the 
Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma
</h3>
(A version of this paper is published in the
<cite> Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</cite>
29:1 (January, 1996):87--112.)
<p>
<strong>Author(s): </strong>
John H. <strong> Miller </strong>
, Department of Social and Decision
Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA  15213.
<p>
<strong>Date: </strong>
Revised 22 March, 1993.
(Forthcoming in Journal of Economic Behavior and Organizations.)
<p>
<strong> Keywords: </strong>
Adaptation, Evolution, Learning, Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game,
Genetic Algorithms, Machine Learning.
<p>
<strong> Abstract: </strong>
A model of learning and adaptation is used to analyze
the coevolution of strategies in the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game 
under both perfect and imperfect reporting.  Meta-players
submit finite automata  strategies and update their
choices through an explicit evolutionary process modeled by a genetic
algorithm.  Using this framework, 
adaptive strategic choice and the emergence of cooperation
are studied through ``computational experiments.''
The results of the analyses
indicate that information conditions lead to significant
differences among the evolving strategies.
Furthermore, they suggest that the general methodology may have
much wider applicability to the analysis of adaptation in economic
and social systems.
