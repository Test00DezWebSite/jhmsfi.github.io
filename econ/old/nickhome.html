The mathematical specification of our model is beyond the scope of
the <em>HTML</em> language, so we have given only a heuristic
description of it here.  We have a PostScript file with the entire
model, <A 
HREF="file://www.pitt.edu/~niklas/homework.ps">homework.ps</A>.
<hr size=5>
With our model, we try to explain the three outcomes that are
possible:  no attempted standing ovation (no one stands), an
unsuccessful standing ovation (a few people stand, but soon sit
down), and a successful standing ovation (everyone or almost
everyone stands).  Thus, we model both standing and sitting by our
agents (audience members).  In our model, we refer to the object of
the (possible) ovation as the "lecturer," although the model could
also describe behavior at other types of performances. 
<P>
Our agents have preferences based on two primitives:
<P>
Altruism/Reciprocity -- A standing ovation confers utility on the
lecturer.  The more agents enjoy the lecture, the more willing they
are to stand.
<P>
Expected Embarassment -- Our agents are shy.  Standing alone, or
with very few others standing, opens up the possibility that our
agents will be embarassed.
<P>
Thus the utility function of our agents looks like this: 
<center><em>
U(Altruism/Reciprocity,Expected \ Embarassment)
</em></center>
<HR>
Rather than being explicitly derived from this primitive
specification, our reduced form is based on four qualities that
affect the primitives.  These qualities are <em>enjoyment</em>,
<em>status of the auditorium</em>, <em>visibility</em>, and
<em>time</em>.  Enjoyment affects the level of
altruism/reciprocity, while status of the auditorium, visibility,
and time affect expected embarassment.  
<P>
We assume that <em>enjoyment</em> is distributed among the agents
in the auditorium according to some distribution function.  The
characteristics of this distribution depend on attributes of the
lecture, venue, <em>etc.</em>, which we take to be exogenously
determined.  We assume that enjoyment does not change with time for
a given agent and that enjoyment is independently and identically
distributed among all agents.  This second assumption is a
simplification, and is probably not realistic; we might expect
agents closer to the front of the auditorium to be more likely to
have a high enjoyment.  Our model can be extended to allow for
heterogeneous (or endogenous) seating in a straightforward way. 
The effect of enjoyment is simple -- the higher the enjoyment, the
more likely the agent is to stand.
<P>
We assume for expository purposes that seats in the auditorium are
arranged in a rectangular array and that all seats are filled,
although the model does not require this.  Given our assumptions,
the <em>status of the auditorium</em> at a given time can be
characterized by a <em>m</em>x<em>n</em> matrix of 0's and 1's,
where the <em>ij</em>-th element of the matrix corresponds to the
agent occupying the seat in the <em>i</em>-th row and <em>j</em>-th
column.  Rows are numbered from front to back (that is, row 1 is
the front row) and columns are numbered from left to right.  A
value of 1 indicates that at this time, the agent is standing,
while a value of 0 indicates that she is sitting.  The status of
the auditorium affects expected embarassment in two ways.  First,
when others are standing, the standing ovation is more likely to be
successful, thus reducing the likelihood of embarassment.  Second,
the amount of embarassment is reduced if others are standing,
particularly if they are nearby.  We thus assume that agents are
more likely to stand when others are standing, and especially when
others nearby are standing. 
<P>
<em>Visibility</em> is assumed to be proxied by an agent's location
in the auditorium, and to the most part by her row.  Visibility
affects expected embarassment in two ways.  On one hand, the more
visible an agent is, the more embarassed she will be if she stands
and the attempted ovation is unsuccessful.  On the other hand, the
more visible she is, the higher the likelihood that the ovation is
successful.  These effects work in opposite directions, but we
assume that the overall effect of visibility is negative; the more
visible an agent is, the less likely she is to stand, all else
being equal.
<P>
<em>Time</em> enters into expected embarassment in a nonlinear way. 
Our casual empiricism leads us to believe that there is a "best
time" to stand, and that standing too soon or too late is somewhat
of a faux pas.
