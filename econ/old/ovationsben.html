I.  Introduction 
</h2>

At the macro level, how can a standing ovation be
described?  Roughly, a 'successful' standing ovation has the following
characteristics:  Initially, a fraction of the audience stands
simultaneously to reward a fine performance.  Over the next few
minutes, more and more audience members join the ovation. What a great
show you think, sitting comfortably in your seat.  Suddenly, you
realize that you are surrounded by a bunch of standing, cheering
people.  You bound to your feet, adding one to the growing standing
ovation.   After a relatively short period of time, the room is taken
over by the standing ovation.  Then, after a few minutes of
enthusiastic clapping, the first wave of people sit down.  Gradually,
others tire as well, or find themselves surrounded by (tired) sitting
audience members, and so sit themselves.  After of few more periods,
the entire audience is again sitting.
<p>
At first glance, this sounds like a nice little story, but hardly
something that one would ponder for any length of time.   Consider it a
little longer, however, and the story begins to look like something
akin to a bandwagon phenomena, which have fascinated economists for
some time.  But more on this later.

<p>

II.  Building the Model.
</h2>

What are the variables the influence one's decision to stand?  We can
divide these into roughly two groups:  Fundamental forces, and the
desire to coordinate.  Further, we want to capture in some way the
mechanism by which decisions of one agent influence those of others.
That is, how does this desire to coordinate manifest itself?  To answer
these question, we need to define the concept of neighborhoods.
Finally, so that we can get an ovation started we introduce inertia at
the individual level.

<p>
A.  Fundamentals:  Initially, we think of our decision to applaud, or
in the extreme to stand in appreciation, as being a function of the
quality of the performance.  We are all, however, differently
predisposed toward showing our appreciation - some clap, others
whistle, still others stand and cheer wildly.  Two people who would
agree on the quality of performance may show their approval in
different ways, or to different degrees.  Thus, our agents are in part
characterized by a fundamental parameter, FUND, which initially
determines when an agent will stand.  For instance, if agent i's
fundamental parameter is 0.75, this tells us that (s)he will not ovate
any performance which (s)he rates at less than or equal to 75/100 on
some personal quality scale (we'll argue that most people can generally
agree on the level of performance, and thus it is only the propensity
to ovate that differs across agents, not perception...)  FUND was drawn
for each agent from a normal distribution on [0,1]1.
<p>

A second fundamental force is the decision to sit down again.
Independent of the number of people standing around you, this variable,
a measure of fatigue or boredom, dictates the number of periods you
will stand.  This is called MAXSTAND, and is uniformly distributed on
[0,T] where T is the duration of the simulation.
<p>

B.  Coordination In many instances, people like to be the same as
others; for various reasons, they like to look (or dress) the same, go
to the same places (pubs),  drive the same cars (keeping up with the
Jones').  I'm no longer familiar with Sunday mass, and so whenever I
attend church, I constantly follow the lead of others - largely because
I don't want to be the only one either sitting or standing.  For these
reasons, we model our agents has being characterized by a second
parameter, a coordination strength, called COORD.  Coordination
strength works as a benchmark.  As an example, consider the case where
COORD = 0.8.  This means that, unless 80% of the people around me are
standing, I will remain sitting.  This is a random number drawn from
the normal distribution on [0,1].
<p>

D.  Defining Neighborhoods:  The Propagation Mechanism This brings us
to our next point:  How do we define the appropriate neighborhood, so
that we can give precise meaning to the word "around"?  There are a
couple of ways to approach this.  One is to think about some aggregate
statistic, like the average number of people standing in the audience.
Under this scenario, all agents are directly connected, although the
strength of each of these connections is quite small.
<p>

Under some circumstances, however, this may not be particularly
satisfying way to model coordination.  A more plausible story would
capture the notion that location matters.  People care more about what
those nearby (geographically or metaphorically) than those at a greater
distance.  In this case, agents are directly connected to fewer people,
although the strength, or importance, of each connection is relatively
large.  Through overlapping neighborhoods, however, all agents are
indirectly connected.

<p>
We try a number of different neighborhood sizes to capture the
qualitative effects they have on the intensity and duration of a
standing ovation.  Of particular note, to be discussed further below,
are neighborhood sizes of N = 2, N = 8, and N = all.

<p>
E.  Inertia Our reason for introducing inertia is intuitively
appealing.  First, in order to see a standing ovation start, anything
short of the whole audience standing at t = 1 requires some stickiness
in agents' decisions to stand, at the very least in the first group to
stand..   Generally this was set equal to 3; that is, those who
initiate the ovation are required to stand for at least three periods,
independent of the actions of anyone else in the audience.  It is not
difficult to justify such an assumption.  We might argue, for instance,
that those who are inclined to stand initially in response to a
particularly good performance will also be willing to stand,
independent of the reactions of others, for some minimum amount of
time.  These people are motivated by fundamental delight rather than
the desire to fit in with a crowd of cheering fans.  Admittedly,
inertia is introduced to the system in an ad hoc fashion.  Ideally,
this inertia would arise endogenously.  At this point, however, it
remains entirely exogen

<p>
F.  The Algorithm:  Describing the Agents and their World Each agent in
the audience, located on the N x M lattice,  is a record, or cellular
automaton, containing a unique set of parameters which are the agent's
behavioral rules: FUND, COORD, MAXSTAND.  These are not updated in any
way over time.  A fourth parameter was added to the record, called z,
which records whether or not the agent has ever been in the standing
state.  In order to ensure that cycling is not realized (ie agents
stand up, sit down, then stand again, etc), we specify that agents
stand only once.  Finally, as we shall discuss further, each agent
carries with them a parameter, IND, which indicates the time at which
they first stood.
<p>
Agents have perfect information, in a world whose dimensions are
defined by the preferences of the agents - ie their specification of
'neighborhood'.  Decision makers here update their binary decision (sit
or stand) on a period by period basis by looking at the current state
of their world - there is no expectations formation going on here.
Finally, since agents are entirely rule based, they are by definition
Rule of Thumb actors.

An outline of the algorithm is appended, along with the code written in
Turbo Pascal.  See Figure 1. [All figures are available from the first author.]

III. Discussion:
</h2>

A.  Preliminary Simulation Results.

<p>
i.  Neighborhood Size and Performance Quality.  In order to see the
effect that neighborhood size has on the realization time of a standing
ovation, a number of simulations were run using different parameter
values.  Of particular interest is neighborhood size.  For notational
convenience, refer to the neighborhood size as N.  If N = 2 then only
those agents directly to the right and left of agent pij will influence
his decision.  The neighborhood is then depicted as a line with one
neighbor on each side of pij.  If  N = 8, all agents directly adjoining
location [i,j] are members of pij's neighborhood.   Finally N = all
means that all agents in the audience are directly connected.  An
aggregate statistic, that is average number standing in the theater, is
the measure used to describe the state of the neighborhood.  One last
notational note: q is the quality of the performance, which falls in
[0,1].

<p>
The results are best illustrated graphically.  See figures 2a,b,c which
shows the results from simulation run using the following parameter
values:

<p>
Fig 2a:  q = 0.8, N = 2, N = 8, N = all.  Fig 2b: q = 0.5,     same Fig
2c: q = 0.3,     same

<p>
Clearly the way in which neighborhoods are defined is key. The smaller
the neighborhood, the longer one must wait before the ovation dies out
entirely.  Further, when we compare N = 2 to N = 8, it is clear that,
given an initial configuration of enthusiasts, the number of members
who stand, at any point in time, is greater under the N = 2 scenario.
This, however, does not hold for the N = all case.

<p>
B.  Directions for Further Work

<p>
i.  Some Problems with the Existing Model Our definition of
neighborhood size is not entirely satisfactory, however.  We would like
to be able to consider intermediate cases, where agents care more about
those close by than those further away.  Moreover, we would like the
rate at which 'caring' declines to be continuous.  As it currently
stands, agents either weight the state of some agent [i,j] by a factor
of 1 or 0.  A more realistic way to model neighborhoods would be to
discount the state of audience member [i,j] sitting r rows away by the
factor {SYMBOL 98 \f "Symbol" \s 12}r-1, where {SYMBOL 98 \f "Symbol"
\s 12} is an individual specific discount rate.  The difficulty in this
approach is in defining a coordination parameter.  Ideally, we want a
number which can be used across all neighborhood specifications.  It is
not clear at this point how to accomplish this.

<p>
ii. Ideas and Applications While this standing ovation model is quite
simple, it represents a useful way to think about modeling certain
economic phenomena, specifically bandwagons.  The links between this
model and one which captures the essence of foreign exchange markets,
stock markets, or international capital flows to highly indebted
counties, are reasonably straight-forward.  These include the concepts
of fundamentals, coordination (which influence behavior), and
neighborhoods.

<p>
Fundamentals.  In the ovation model, fundamentals determined the number
to stand in the first period.  The quality of performance, along with
the natural predisposition of the audience members, were alone
responsible for the number standing in period one.  The analogy to a
foreign exchange market, for instance, is clear.  Traders look, at
least to some degree, at country fundamentals in forming expectations
and making trades.  However, while everyone can agree that double digit
inflation does not bode well for a currency, traders have different
inclinations to react to marginal changes in fundamentals.

<p>
Coordination.  The desire to coordinate with others in the audience at
a theatrical performance is a pure coordination phenomena; we like to
do the same thing as others because we dislike standing out in a
crowd.  The motivation behind coordination in a model of foreign
exchange trading, on the other hand, is motivated by appealing to
imperfect information.  We may not have access to all (perfect)
information, so we look at what others are doing to inform our decision
making.

<p>
Neighborhoods.  In the context of a well-defined theater or concert
hall, the concept of neighborhood is entirely geographic. It is also
exogenously determined and fixed.  The same notion, however, can be
applied to interactions which are not strictly geographic.
Neighborhoods can be defined by communications networks, trading
coalitions, etc.  Further, these networks, or neighborhoods, are both
endogenous and dynamic.  Not only to agents in these settings define
their set of interactions, they can also change this set over time.

<p>
While there are clear links between the simple ovation model and one
which would capture the richness of behavior in these speculative
markets, there are also distinct differences.  The concept of updating
expectations, for instance, stands out as a key example.  In the
ovation model, for instance, it is hard to think of  what success or
failure might mean for an agent.  Thus, behavioral rules are not
updated over time.  In a foreign exchange market, however, the concept
of success is more clearly defined.  In such a market, we must think of
the set of behavioral rules as evolving over time.

<p>
Nonetheless, the basic ingredients of the ovation model provide us with
insight into the modeling of more complex problems.  In particular, the
focus of future work will be on the interplay between fundamentals and
coordination, the concept of neighborhoods, and the suspicion that
inertia must play an role in explaining bandwagon phenomena.

1 A normal distribution was used to capture the idea that, while agents
are all different, there is often a lot of similarity in our
preferences; while we all care to different degrees about coordinating
our actions, most people can broadly be characterized as 'moderate'.
Simulations run using a uniform distribution did not yield
qualitatively different results.  Ideally we'd like to truncate this
distribution so that it is drawn on [xL,1], where xL >> 0, for instance
on [0.5,1]
