<br><font size=+1>Modeling a Cocktail Party</font>
<br><a href="http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~dschreib/">Darren Schreiber</a> and
Troy Tassier</center>

<p>We set out to create a model where guests at a party desire to mingle
with other guests.&nbsp; Guests had an inclination to spend varying amounts
of time with each other guest.&nbsp; Once the party begins they seek out
the person within their vision who they are most attracted to.&nbsp; As
guests interact their inclination to spend additional time with each other
diminishes.&nbsp; Once guests run out of people they are attracted to,
they leave the party.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Model:</font>
<p>The party takes place in a 100 x 100 room with 21 guests.
<p><u>Each guest has:</u>
<blockquote>Level of attraction (randomly distributed) to each other guest.
<br>Vision (constant for all guests).
<br>Contact distance (constant for all guests).
<br>Attraction decay rate (constant for all guests).
<br>Position in the room (initial position set randomly).</blockquote>

<p><br><u>Each period every guest:</u>
<blockquote>1.&nbsp; Looks around to see who is within their vision.
<br>2.&nbsp; If no one within vision has positive attraction, leave the
party.
<br>3.&nbsp; If someone with positive attraction is within sight, move
toward most attractive guest until within
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contact distance.
<br>4.&nbsp; If no one within contact distance is attractive, move the
opposite direction of the person you were
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talking to.
<br>5.&nbsp; Decrease your attraction to all people within contact distance.</blockquote>

<p>In the simulation below, twenty-one guests are randomly distributed
in the room.&nbsp; They each implement the five steps described above.&nbsp;
Early in the party, guests cluster into large groups.&nbsp; After some
time, people tire of talking to the people in their group and spread out.&nbsp;
New groups form, converse, and decay.&nbsp; When guests are unable to find
someone interesting in their vision, they leave the party.
