<P>

At parties, you talk, eat, drink, and hopefully have fun. At any time,
a few people
may be found standing alone along the edge of the wall, but the
majority are found in little groups scattered around the room. In
these groups, you have conversations with fellow partygoers, and these
conversations may be interesting or not. If the conversation is bad,
you will probably leave, perhaps staying a little while out of
politeness before making an excuse, and if the conversation is good,
you will likely stay longer, unless you need another drink. If you are
alone, or have just left a group, you may choose to join the same one,
or another, especially if the people in that group look like they are
enjoying themselves. Thus groups form, change and dissolve, as people
move around the room.

<P>

This webpage contains a model of a party with 21 people. The purpose
is to model partygoer decisionmaking in a party, and the resulting
formation, perturbation and dissolution of the groups they form.

<P>

In this model, people have the following choices. They may

<OL>
<LI> join a group
<LI> leave a group
<LI> do neither
</OL>

and as a result, they may

<OL>
<LI> be in a group (of at least two people)
<LI> be alone
</OL>

To simplify the description, from now on, a person who is alone at the
party will be considered to form a group of size one.

<P>

A person's decision is based on how happy he is in his group, as well
as his propensity to be alone if he is not. There are other factors,
such as thirst, which also affect his choice. The effect of these
other factors are modelled by including randomness in his decision.

<P>

While in a group, a person's level of happiness depends on the
characteristics of the group members, and their resulting
interactions.

<HR>

<H3>
Notation:
</H3>

Let N = {1, 2, ... , 21} be the set of partygoers.

<P>

For partygoer i in N, let i's propensity to be alone be denoted a_i,
which is a real number. In the model, this is chosen from a uniform
distribution between -5 and 5.

<P>

If S is a group or subset of partygoers contained in N, let f denote a
function which assigns to each possible subset of partygoers a real
number which represents the happiness of the group. The
characteristics of f will be defined <A HREF="#ghfunc">later</A>. This
value is also chosen to be between -5 and 5 uniformly.

<HR>

<A NAME="assumptions">
<H3>
Assumptions:
</H3>
</A>

<OL>
<LI> a group member's happiness level is the same as the happiness
level of the group; as group members interact, they will affect each
others moods until they are all equally happy or unhappy
<LI> partygoers do not know their effect on a group when they join or
leave, and do not learn
<LI> partymembers arrive simultaneously, and are initially alone;
whether or not people arrive at once or apart makes no difference in
the long run due to the model setup, but is done for convenience in
programming; this will be clear from the model setup
</OL>

<HR>

<H3>
Model Setup:
</H3>

The model occurs in discrete time. At each time t, each partygoer i
has the following decision:

<UL>
<LI> if i is in a group S, to stay or leave; i decides to leave with
probability exp(a_i)/(exp(a_i) + exp(f(S)); in this way, i leaves
with higher probability when he is unhappy in the group, or he does
not mind being alone
<LI> if i leaves, or was already alone, he randomizes among the groups
and being alone; if G is a group at time t, then i joins G with
probability exp(f(G))/(sum(f(H)) + exp(a_i)), where the sum is over
all groups H at time t except the group of consisting of only i
<LI> a variant of this which is not done is where i joins each group
with equal probability  
</UL>

Group Happiness Function:
</H3>
</A>

When a person leaves or joins a group, this may either lower or raise
that group's happiness. The way in which this happens depends on an
interconnectedness parameter k, which ranges from 1 to 21, the number
of people at the party.

<P>

When k is one, group happiness is just the average contribution of
each group member.

<P>

When k is two, group happiness is the average contribution of each
possible pair of people in the group (there are k choose 2 pairs),
which captures the idea that group member interactions make up group
happiness. 

<P>

A given value of k means that group happiness is the average of the
contribution of all size-k subsets of the group when the group is at
least as big as k. When the group size is less than k, then the
happiness of group G is given by f(G).

<P>

Therefore the addition or deletion of a group member will add or drop
terms from the calculation of happiness. By the 
<A HREF="#ghfunc">definition of f</A>, the average change is zero,
and by <A HREF="#assumptions">an assumption</A>, people do not learn
the parameters of f, so this justifies the use of group happiness to
choose a group to join.

<HR>

<H3>
Simulation Setup:
</H3>

To show the effect of interconnectedness, we run three versions: k=1,
where contributions to happiness are linear; k=2, where
contributions depend on pairwise interactions or contributions; and
k=21, where group happiness is a function of the entire group.

<H3>
Results:
</H3>

<H4>Happiness</H4>
For each k, we compare its effect by plotting average group happiness.

<P><IMG SRC="k21_h.gif" ALT="[Happiness vs. Time, k=21]" ALIGN="CENTER">

<HR>

<P>First, it is clear that happiness varies a lot over time. In all
three cases, though, it starts off below 0 and ends up on average
above 0, so people become happier as the party progresses. By
inspection, people are happiest when k=2. For k=1, everyone's
contribution enters into the group happiness calculation. The variance
in happiness is due to group size - a few small happy groups add to
happiness more than one big happy group, for instance. 

<P>For k=2, there is complementarity. People who get along can join the
same group, while those who don't can avoid each other. By inspection,
average group happiness tends to be higher.

<P>For k=21, happiness depends on the group. Recall that for group
sizes less than k, happiness is a function of the whole group, not any
average of subgroup contributions, and this is chosen
randomly. Nonetheless, on average, it appears that average happiness
in the longer run is about the same as that for k=2.

<H4>Group Sizes</H4>

<P>Group sizes also vary over time.

<P>For k=21

<P><IMG SRC="k21_g.gif" ALT="[Happiness vs. Time, k=1]" ALIGN="CENTER">

<HR>

<P>Group sizes show less variance. Happiness changes with each change
in group composition, but group size can stay the same if the same
number leave as come in.

<H3>
Conclusions:
</H3>

<P>The evidence suggests that a higher interconnectedness parameter k
results in slightly happier people, and possibly smaller groups. The
difficulty with using k large, is that a small change in group
composition can result in a drastic change in group happiness,
especially when the group size is less than k. This may be
unrealistic.

<P>In a mathematical note, 
if we define a state to be the set of groups at a given time, there
are a finite number of states, since the number of partygoers is
finite. Since we are using a random utility model, every state can
result in everyone being alone, and when everyone is alone, it is
strictly possible for any state to follow. Thus the system is ergodic,
and an invariant distribution of states exists. With 21 partygoers,
there are many states, so calculating the invariant distribution would
take a very long time and will not be done.

<HR>

<H3>
Future Directions and Questions:
</H3>

<P>The data is very noisy. For future research, many more rounds, or the
inclusion of some "inertia", in partygoer movement from group to group
may result in a better long-term/end of party predictions, or a more
realistic model of parties.

<P>A more complete analysis would include testing all different values of
k, and the effect of different propensities to be alone on the speed
of convergence and the final results.

<P>Applications of this analysis naturally include the formation of
networks: social, economic or political.
