<h3>
2000 Graduate Workshop in Computational Economics
</h3>
<h2>
Student Participants

<hr>
<p>
This year we had over 30 very well-focused, high quality applicants.
We inevitably end up being limited more by our capacity to 
effective work with the group than by the quality of the applicants.  
Over the past few years we have found that the workshop is much
more productive when we can identify students with interests that easily overlap
with one another and the faculty.  If you did not get in to the workshop, 
it was most likely because we were unable to identify this overlap, 
and not because we felt your skills or project had little potential.  
Please feel free to apply to next year's
workshop, and in the interim 
keep in touch with us and the web site.
