<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Problem</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider the following situation:</font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A group of, say, 20 students 
  is given a homework problem once a week for each of fifteen weeks. Once a given 
  homework problem is assigned, it is due the next day. Students are allowed to 
  form and reform into groups as they so desire. </font>
<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assumptions</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each agent <i>i</i> possesses two 
  exogenous attributes intelligence, <i>I<sub>i</sub></i>, and work ethic, <i>W<sub>i</sub></i>. Both attributes may 
  take on either the value of 0 or 1.</font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A value 0 for intelligence 
  implies that the student is dumb, while a value of 1 implies the student is 
  intelligent. Similarly, for work ethic if the value is 0, then the agent is 
  lazy. However, if the value is a 1, then the agent is hardworking state.</font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One quarter of the agents 
  were of each combination of intelligence and work ethic.</font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Agents are permitted to 
  work with any number of others</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">on the homework. However, 
  we have set the optimal number of members for a group to three.</font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The grade for each member 
  of group <i>g</i> is given by </font> 
<p align="center"><img src="gradeeqn.gif" width="142" height="72">
<p>
<p> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">where </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I<sub>i</sub></i> takes on either the value 
  of 0 or 1.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>W<sub>i</sub></i> takes on either the values 
  of 0 or 1.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>n<sub>g</sub></i> is the number 
  of members of the group.</font> 
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We assume that each agent 
  derives utility solely from his grade.</font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First hand knowledge and 
  reputation: </font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First Hand Knowledge:</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once an agent <i>i</i> works 
  with agent <i>j</i> , then agent <i>i</i> knows <i>j'</i>s work ethic and intelligence.</font> 
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reputation:</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reputation is used in place 
  of first hand knowledge, if agent <i>i</i> has not worked with agent <i>j</i> 
  in the past. Agent <i>j'</i>s reputation is calculated by average <i>j</i>'s 
  grade over the previous assignments. If <i>j</i>'s average is one standard 
  deviation above the mean <i>j</i> is considered to be both intelligent and hardworking. 
  If <i>j</i>'s average is within one standard deviation of the mean, then <i>j</i> 
  is considered to be hardworking or intelligent but not both. Finally, if <i>j</i>'s average is one standard deviation below the mean, then <i>j</i> is considered 
  to be lazy and dumb.</font> 
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Order of search for agent

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask individuals which <i>i</i> knows are hardworking, and intelligent.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask individuals which <i>i</i> thinks are hardworking and intelligent based on reputation.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask individuals which <i>i</i> knows are hardworking and not intelligent, or are lazy too bright, or are lazy 
  and intelligent.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask individuals who may 
  be hardworking and not intelligent, or may be lazy and not intelligent.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask people who may be lazy 
  and not intelligent.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask people who are lazy 
  and not intelligent.</font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Agents may stop the search 
  earlier than the last step in assumption 7, if the agent will be worse off by 
  asking another student to join the group than by not asking the agent. The agents 
  may stop the search earlier than the last step in assumption 7, if the agent 
  will be worse off by asking another student to join the group than by not asking 
  the student.</font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An agent may decline to 
  be a member of a group if the agent believes that an he believes that he will 
  be worse off by joining the asking agents group than working by himself.</font>
<p>
<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Algorithm</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our algorithm is loosely 
  based on the stable marriage problem algorithm, which is a simple algorithm 
  to pair people up in the best way possible, that is to maximize their happiness. 
  It started (of course) in the sixties, with the original goal to investigate 
  if global coupling was possible, but is has grown into many other areas of application 
  as well. In the paper by Caldarelli and Capocci [1] (for the reader who lacks 
  in either attribute <i>I</i> or <i>W</i>, a popular version is given by New 
  Scientist [2]), a desirable quality of beauty is introduced, which relates to 
  our attributes intelligence and work ethic. Inspired by this we came up with 
  the algorithm described below. </font> 
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When forming the groups 
  every week, an agent is randomly picked to try to form a group. When an agent 
  searches for a group member she only searches for individuals who are not already 
  in a group. The order of the search that the agent uses is given in assumption 
  7. Additionally, the agent will only pick a member if she believes that individual 
  will improve the groups overall grade, as mentioned in assumption 8. If an agent 
  is asked to join a group, he may decline the offer (assumption 9). The agent 
  will decline the offer, if he believes that he is worse off by joining the group 
  than going it alone. In the first round no information of the other agents qualities 
  are known to any of the agents, and the groups will thus be formed without taking 
  this into account, which is not a problem. </font>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the agent has finished 
  her search another agent is then selected to search for additional members of 
  his or her group. This process is repeated until all lone individuals are picked 
  into groups or until no group or individual wants to add new members to the 
  group. Once this occurs grades are given and both private and public reputations 
  are updated.</font>
<p>
<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Results</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After running the simulation 
  100 times, we note that hard working students do not necessarily work together 
  very often. This is born out by examining the average final grade of students 
  over the 15 weeks for the run. The maximum grade a student may receive is 6 
  (this occurs when three hardworking and intelligent students work together). 
  However, looking at the final grades it is easy to see that good students (agents 
  1 through 5) score well below the average. While, poor students do much better 
  than scoring the amount that would be expected if they worked together (agents 
  16 to 20 on the chart below).</font>
<p>

<p align="center"><img src="average100.gif" width="576" height="432"><br>
  <br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reason that good students 
  do not often work together is because a good student will be willing to work 
  with a poor student if the poor student's group has fewer than three people. 
  The reason the good student will join a bad group is because she will be better 
  off by joining the group than going it alone. This myopic view is what generates 
  the results.</font>

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further Research</font> 
</h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To improve upon are work 
  we would like to examine the effects of the following modifications to our model:</font> 
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Different Grading Function</font> 
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Explicit Utility for 
    Leisure</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Explicit Implementation 
    of Cost Function</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relate to Other Search 
    Rules</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuous Values for 
    Characteristics</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Different Starting Population 
    of Agents</font> </li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Applicable Social Science 
  Problems</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a very general issue, 
  which has equivalencies in many areas where pairing occurs. Some examples might 
  be to match medical students with residency vacancies in hospitals, supply and 
  demand, fill job vacancies or even determine the best way to distribute battery 
  recharging stations in a space station inhabited by roaming robots, as described 
  by New Scientist [2].</font>
