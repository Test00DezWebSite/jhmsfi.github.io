The Santa Fe Institute Economics Program is pleased to announce the fifth
annual
Graduate Workshop in Economics. The workshop will bring together a group of
advanced graduate students and a small faculty for an intensive two week
study of
computational economics. The workshop will consist of lectures by faculty,
special topic
seminars by members of the Santa Fe Institute, and presentations of work in
progress by
graduate student participants. The primary goal of the summer workshop is
to assist
graduate students pursuing research agendas which include a computational
component.
A significant portion of the workshop will be devoted to analyzing and
improving
research being conducted by the graduate student participants.

<p>
To get a better idea about workshop activities and focus, please

expenses will be supported by the workshop.

<p>
Sponsorship of this program is provided by Coopers & Lybrand, L.L.P.
