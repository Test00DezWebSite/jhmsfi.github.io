The Santa Fe Institute is pleased to announce the 
eleventh annual Graduate Workshop in Computational Social Science
Modeling and Complexity. 
The workshop will bring together a group of
advanced graduate students and a small faculty for an intensive two week
study of
computational social science modeling and complexity. 
The workshop will consist of lectures by faculty,
special topic
seminars by members of the Santa Fe Institute, and presentations of work in
progress by
graduate student participants. The primary goal of the summer workshop is
to assist
graduate students pursuing research agendas which include a computational
modeling component.
A significant portion of the workshop will be devoted to analyzing and
improving
research being conducted by the graduate student participants.

<h3>
To Apply
</h3>

<p>
Applicants ideally should have completed a minimum of two years of graduate study in
economics or other social science fields
and be actively pursuing research in computational social science
(highly qualified applicants who do not meet these exact criteria
will also be considered).
Interested
students should submit a recent curriculum vitae, at least one letter of
recommendation,
two other references, and a one page outline of a current or proposed research
project in
computational social sciences. Preference will be given to applicants who best
demonstrate
the ability to successfully complete research in this area.

<p>
Women and minorities are encouraged to apply.

<p>
Completed applications should be sent to Scott E. Page at the Michigan
