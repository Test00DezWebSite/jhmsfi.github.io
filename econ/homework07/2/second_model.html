<h1>Grid Layout of Parking Population Modeling</h1>
<ul>
  <li>A set of Stores arranged in a line
  <li>Each parking row is parallel to the line of stores
  <li>Each row has the same number of parking spaces as there are stores
  <li>The preference of each customer is assigned uniformly randomly
</ul>
  
 The parameters considered in the model are:
<ul>
     <li>The arrival rate of cars
     <li>The departure rate of cars
     <li>The strategy used by each car to choose the parking space depends on its proximity to the store of preference.
  </ul>

This graph shows a parking lot as a 10x10 grid where cars arrive with a Poisson probability distribution with mean of 10. There is no departure. The cars arrive and have a favorite column to park in which is linked to the preference of the store that the driver chooses. This is a Depth First Population model

<h3>Observations</h3>

The results, while considering only a 10x10 grid, show that the average distance to the store of preference is greater when the drivers park using a Breadth First model than a Depth First model. <br>
Under the assumptions of this model (uniform distribution of store preferences, distribution of arrivals...) the results show that when designing a parking lot, it appears that it would be more beneficial to lay the parking spots in a column style facing the stores rather than in a line.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
The model is implemented using the R language and is available <a href="ParkSim.R">here</a>.
