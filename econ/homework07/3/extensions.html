<br><br><b>Future Directions</b><br>

This model asks "How do the habits of shoppers interact with the design of the parking lot? How does it affect the business?" To answer this question we created a simple model of a double row parking lot with a unidirectional path between the two rows. There are several ways in which this model could be extended:
<li>Design different parking lot entry/exit points depending on customer habits, i.e. their tendency to wait and their preference to park close to the mall entrance. Under what conditions will it be better to have a single row of n spaces with one entry and exit or two rows of n/2 spaces with two entries and two exits? 
<li>Incorporate more realistic driver behavior such as backing up. Another possibility is to add heterogeneity in how far ahead a driver can look before deciding what to do. 
<li>Incorporate a bidirectional layout: gates are both entry and exit points and drivers can drive in both directions when looking for a place to park.
