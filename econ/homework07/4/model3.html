  <p><b>Description:</b> This model is an unsuccessful attempt at developing a 
    useful adaptive version of the previous model. Two algorithms were tested, 
    one in which the threshold was modified after each parking event based on 
    the normalized ratio of regret to time spent driving. This model always moved 
    quickly to a uniform threshold value of 0, notable as the worst possible threshold 
    from a utility maximization perspective. The second model was an attempt to 
    use a cognitively simple update procedure based on the same two variables 
    such that if the regret was non zero the threshold was updated to be 10% more 
    risk seeking. If the driving time exceeded the maximum distance of the parking 
    row the threshold was updated to be 10% less risk seeking. This was normalized 
    primitively by disallowing a threshold that exceeds 1. This dynamic drives 
    the threshold for all agents to 1; another non-optimal result.</p>

  <p>No outcomes are reported for this model as it is believed to be incomplete 
    and only partially functional.</p>
