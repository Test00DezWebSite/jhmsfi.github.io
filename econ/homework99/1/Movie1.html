<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  <B>The Hypothesis</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first part we are modeling in a very simple way what may induce individuals in different locations to go and see a movie the first time it shows in a movie theater. None of them know the quality of the movie, therefore they need to take a decision based on whatever information they can gather. In our case, where all the agents are assumed to be arranged on a circle, each agent use the two most immediate right and left neighbors in order to infer some information about the quality of the movie. In particular, more neighbors are expected to go and see the movie, the higher the probability an agent is going to see the movie, either because he think neighbors have more information about the quality, or because it is simply more fun going to the movie theater with some companion. Everyone behaves exactly in the same way, so that unless there is something, which differs across location, agents at every location are expected to go to the movie theater exactly with the same probability. We found this result for the static equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is assumed that each location has a different cultural background, differences among locations become the norm. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many possible extensions. First would be interesting to change the structure of the interactions and observe how robust are the results. The best approach would be using a computational model and simulate our framework on a lattice. We expect to find interesting clustering or group behavior. Second it would be very interesting to model cultural diffusion and look for absorbing sets in which part of the population go and see the movie while other not, without any incentive for a single agent surrounded by agents having the same strategy to unilaterally change action. Also for this kind of problem, a computational model would constitute a better methodology. </P>

<P>The equation </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image1.gif" WIDTH=405 HEIGHT=64>,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>which determines the static equilibrium in heterogeneous case becomes very difficult to solve numerically when the number of agents is large.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Constructing a Gibbs Sampler is a possible way out. To use it we have to adjust our model in the following way. From now on agents do not have expectations about their neighbors’ choices.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>Remark</I>. The fact that agents do not form expectations about their neighbors’ choices allows a different interpretation for <IMG SRC="Image2.gif" WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=24>’s: it can be explained as a reaction to the movie.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Instead we assume that the conditional distribution of agents’ choices given the choices of their neighbors is</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image26.gif" WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=54></P>
<P>To approximate the joint distribution of the a<SUB>i</SUB>’s it is enough to construct the series of random states a<SUP>1</SUP>,…, a<SUP>B</SUP> using the Gibbs sampling. At every scan we update each a<SUB>i</SUB> from the corresponding conditional distribution treating a<SUB>i-1</SUB> and a<SUB>i+1</SUB> as given. Generalized law of large numbers ensures that empirical averages accurately approximate features of the joint distribution.</P>

<OL>

</FONT><LI>External shocks <IMG SRC="Image28.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=21> can have a spatial structure. For example, we can model this way that people in different cities read different reviews.</LI>
<LI>In some cities there are movie theaters where movies are shown a couple of months after they were released at low prices. This feature can be captured in our model as well if we allow prices for the movies to decrease over time.</LI>
<LI>The spatial structure of the model can be generalized as well. Assume that at the beginning we randomly connect people in the society. In that case an individual’s probability that the movie is of the good quality will depend not on just two neighbors’ choices, but on the choices of everybody who is the peer group of that individual. </LI></OL>
