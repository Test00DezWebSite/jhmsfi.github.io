<p><b><font size=+1>I. INTRODUCTION</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The present model is
about two factors affecting movie attendance of members of a delimited
peer group. First are the "tastes" of individuals-how people (heterogeneously)
evaluate the intrinsic attributes of movies that cause them to see movies
independently of others. Second is the effect of "buzz" on movie attendance.
Buzz in turn has two components: what people who saw the movie say about
it, and how many people saw the movie (e.g., <i>The English Patient, Star
Wars</i>-numbers give reason for seeing a movie even if it's no good).
That is, buzz contains an issue of movie quality as conveyed by peers (which
of course implies that buzz is indirectly influenced by those individuals'
heterogeneous reactions to the same movie), and of the "faddishness" of
a movie.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>II. THE MODEL</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The model is implemented
as a learning classifier system. This allows representation of a large
number of agents (100 in our initial trials), each of which makes a decision
(about movie attendance in our case) in response to its environment. Part
of its environmental message, in turn, is composed of the decisions of
other agents. A classifier system specifies a collection of decision rules,
which map environmental conditions into decisions. A decision rule is then
one and the same with the agent it represents.</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The interactive component
of this model is that part of an agent's environmental condition is itself
a function of the decisions of other agents. For simplicity, we model each
agent as having three possible decisions: "see the movie and like it,"
"see the movie and dislike it," and "don't see the movie." (Note that for
convenience in implementation, an agent does not actually know which decision
it makes when going to see the movie, as by assumption people don't see
movies they know they won't enjoy. Rather, the enjoyment is determined
probabilistically for agents who see the movie.) An agent's enjoyment of
the movie is reported to all other agents, who are more likely to see the
movie if peers who have seen it like it. Agents are also more likely to
see a movie if a large number of peers have seen it, regardless of their
enjoyment. This is the "fad effect" or, more appropriately, the "<i>English
Patient </i>effect."</font></font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The intrinsic, non-interactive
(at least not directly) aspects of the movie are common in the environment
faced by each agent. In this model, the intrinsic aspects are: the "type"
of movie (here comedy or drama, but easily generalizable to multinomial
and/or multidimensional type spaces such as star power or director); the
report of critics (either favorable or unfavorable); and whether the movie
is likely to be crowded (either crowded or not). Type and critical reviews
are fixed at the start for a given movie, but crowdedness can vary over
time, to account for the fact that movies are generally more crowded on
opening weekend. See below for more on the disconnect between crowdedness
and whether any agents have seen the movie. This is certainly a restriction
and eliminates movies like <i>Life is Beautiful</i> that get more crowded
well into their releases, as a result of the buzz. Certainly the model's
parameters could easily be altered to allow for movies that become more
popular into their releases, but it must be taken as exogenous. Learning
classifier systems allow for heterogeneous reactions to the same movie
on the part of different agents because the decision rule used is can be
made probabilistic; this is to be interpreted as a decision with a component
that is random to an outside observer.</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>One of the most useful
features of the learning classifier system for our purposes is that it
allows for an endogenous determination of the faddishness of a movie. If
early viewers see it and like it, later viewers facing the same environmental
condition are also more likely to see it and like it. Similarly, if early
viewers see it and dislike it, later viewers in the same environmental
conditions are more likely to see it and dislike it. This results from
the dynamic alteration in the probability a given decision rule is selected
under any given conditions, a general feature of learning classifier systems:
if a decision rule fires at any time, its probability of firing later is
changed.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The model assumes away
problems of budget constraint, transportation, distance to theater, theater
characteristics, and especially problem of finding a date. Movie budgets
could actually be included, by assuming different people require much more
favorable conditions for a movie before they become very likely to see
it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Agents do not evaluate
the gamble they face over movie attendance in an expected utility sense.
Agents can face negative expected utility from attending--e.g., if conditional
on seeing the movie they are extremely likely to dislike it in a certain
condition--and still attend. The interpretation is as a sort of bounded
rationality, if an admittedly somewhat ad hoc one.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>It is possible for
"crowds" to be big even though no agents see the movie, or even if all
agents have seen the movie. The interpretation is that a group of agents
represents a group of friends, not the entire moviegoing population (even
in a given area). Also note that agents infer nothing about the movie quality
from the size of the crowd.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>III. IMPLEMENTATION</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>In this section we
explain some important features of learning classifier systems and some
specifics of our implementation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>In a classifier system
information flows from the environment to the agent through its detectors,
which decode the information into one or more messages, usually represented
in binary strings whose values are members of the alphabet {0,1}. These
messages activate zero, one or more classifier rules at any given time,
and out of these matching classifiers, an auction takes place to determine
the current winner, which posts its action in the environment through the
effectors.&nbsp; The classifier rule consists of two parts: &lt;condition>:&lt;action>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>All matching classifiers
make bids according their <i>strength</i>&nbsp; i.e, according to how successful
they have been. The winner can be chosen by selecting the one offering
the highest bid or by adding some normally distributed, zero-mean noise
with a specified noise deviation <i>bidsigma</i> into its deterministic
<i>bid</i>, called effective bid -<i>ebid</i>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>When starting the program
we provide a seed (a real value between 0 and 1) which initializes the
random number generator. In the next section, we provide results of runs
with different seed values.</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>This is a rudimentary description to acquaint the reader
with the basic idea. For more on learning classifier systems and complete
descriptions of the parameters used, refer to chapter 6 of David E. Goldberg's
<i>Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning</i>
(Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1989).</font>
<br><font size=+1></font>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Representation</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The environmental message
and the condition part of the classifiers are both represented in a bit
string of length 6, where the classifier's string is part of the alphabet
{0,1,#}. The # is a "don't care" symbol matching both, a 0 or a 1 in the
incoming message. The action is a string one bit long which takes any of
the same three values.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The environmental message
provides the following to the classifier's condition part:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Movie attributes. Specify
the type of movie in question: comedy (1) or drama (0).</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Critics. Reports that
are either favorable (1) or unfavorable (0), but are not given by friends
(i.e. they are sources of public information such as magazines, newspapers,
etc.). This variable is represented randomly with equal probability of
having it 0 or 1.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Opinion of peers. The
average of the friend's opinions.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The number of friends
who have actually seen the movie. It takes two bits for the classifier
rule to represent the percentage of friends who have seen the movie. It
ranges from 0-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-100%, and it is represented as 00, 01,
10 and 11 respectively.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Crowd. We have arbitrarily
defined it as being "big" during the first 1/4 of the time span of the
experiment (resembling the firsts few weeks of the release of a movie),
and "small" after that period.</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The classifier's action
can take any of these values:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>0 when the agent saw the
movie and did not like it</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>1 when it saw it and liked
it</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1># when did not see it.</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font size=+1>Time is discrete and indexed as <i>t. </i>At any given instant
in time, the agent's actions are collected and added to the statistics
of opinions. At <i>t </i>= 0, no agents have seen the movie because it
has just been released. As time progresses, the agents are receiving a
richer state of the environment as more and more friends have seen it.
The general opinion of peers is evaluated from the subtraction of the number
of friends who liked it and the ones who disliked it. If this is a positive
number, the opinion of peers is favorable. Agents who have seen the movie
from here on will be called <i>viewers</i>.&nbsp; Note that <i>viewers</i>
not only have seen the movie in question, but they have also given their
opinions about it.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The number of agents in the model is set to be 100, but
it can easily be replaced by any other number. We though 100 represents
most of the space of possibilities. Results of runs with different seed
values and either with noise or without it are given in the following section.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>IV.&nbsp; RESULTS</font></font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Although we performed several simulations, we are only
presenting results of some of them. These seeds were selected because they
show the range of effects of adding random noise; also within a noise treatment
they show the sensitivity of results on the seed. For other seeds, the
effect of adding noise lies somewhere between these results. Within a noise
treatment, there is a strong non-monotonicity with respect to changes in
seed.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Each example consists of 100 agents, each making an attendance
decision and giving a report about the movie. Viewers who see the movie
and like it are listed as "happy viewers," and viewers who see it and don't
like are denoted "unhappy viewers."</font>

<p><i><font size=+1>General Comments</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The results show in each case that for a given seed, adding
random noise to a rule's effective bid dampens the "fad effect" of a movie.
In every case, however, the results and associated dynamics also show a
clear duality of influence on movie demand--namely, the buzz created by
peers who see a movie early, and the influence of movie attributes independent
of the buzz.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Dynamics</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Preliminary observations of the results gave us some insight
about changes in the agents' opinions about the movie and their desire
to go and see it. For example, early viewers tend to see the movie and
enjoy it:&nbsp;viewers after the first few to see and enjoy the movie tend
to have similar environments (e.g., crowdedness and number of peers who
have seen the movie). The same decision fires because of its success early
on in this environment. As the environment changes over time, that advantage
is dampened and the rule of "see the movie and dislike it" tends to get
chosen. The emerging pattern is that the satisfied viewers, <i>as a proportion
of those who have decided to see the movie, starts</i> out fairly close
to 1. Over time that proportion declines to anywhere from 2/3 to 1/2, depending
on parameters.&nbsp; Moreover, this pattern was evident in the No Noise
treatments. When random noise was added to effective bids, even early on
the ration of satisfied viewers to all viewers tended to be close to 1/2,
as expected.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The punch line is that people who see a movie early tend
to be excited about it, and are captured in our model as satisfied viewers.
Essentially, there is a selection bias operating on early viewers. Later
viewers, however, are later viewers for a reason--they are not so excited
about the movie and tend to be less satisfied with it. (We note the important
caveat that the model does not allow for repeat viewing:&nbsp;there is
no Leonardo DiCaprio in our world.)</font>
<br><font size=+1></font>&nbsp;
<br><font size=+1></font>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>V. EXTENSIONS AND
FUTURE WORK</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Several extensions
have already been described above. For example, we could easily make the
"type space" of the movie multinomial and multidimensional. For example,
a "Leonardo DiCaprio effect"&nbsp;could be easily included by expanding
the length of the bit string representing environmental messages.</font></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>In addition, the initial
probability that a decision rule is the one to fire under a particular
condition is the same for each possible decision rule. This could be relaxed
by altering the initial strength associated with each decision rule. This
latter extension is a simple way to implicitly represent preferences in
the learning classifier system framework. Alternatively, preferences could
be included as part of the environmental conditions. The latter route is
worth exploring, because its explicitness is more satisfying.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>For a multi-movie setting,
the action space of the model could be easily generalized to size n3. The
conditions space could also be generalized, to account for heterogeneity
in tastes for comedies, the weight of movie critics, and movie budgets.
In principle, the multi-movie model could be calibrated with actual data,
enabling recommendations of conditions which are favorable for release
of a certain type of movie. In addition, for movies with a particular release
date (e.g., summer, when many other movies are out there), the model could
recommend characteristics a movie should have (e.g., star power).</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>Although classifier systems and genetic algorithms are
complementary to each other, in the present model the genetic action is
disabled, meaning that it does not evolve new rules as time progresses
-it only uses preexisting ones. The genetic algorithm is built in the system,
so it would be very interesting to run simulations and observe the effect
evolution would have in the patterns of the agents' preferences.</font>
