<h3>
1995 Graduate Workshop in Computational Economics
</h3>

Student Participants

<p>
This year we had over 50 applicants for
the 14 spaces.  If you did not get into the school this year
please do not be discouraged, as there were far more qualified
students than spaces available.  It is likely that next year
a similar workshop will be held.  Also, we will try and use
this web site as a way to ``network'' (literally) all of
this interest into a cohesive working group.
