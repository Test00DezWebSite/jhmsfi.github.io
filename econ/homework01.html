<h2> Deja Vu</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Consider the following situation:

<p>

A group of, say, 20 students is given a homework problem once a week
for each of fifteen weeks.  Once a given homework problem is assigned, it is
due the next day.
Students are allowed to form and reform into groups as they so desire.

<p>
<nl>
<li>
Model, using whatever techniques you wish, the formation of the
groups.
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Explicitly state your model and key assumptions.
   <li> Summarize any results.
   <li> Suggest some potentially interesting future directions and
questions for
        the model.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Suggest some standard social science scenarios that could be
usefully modeled
using such a process.
