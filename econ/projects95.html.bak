Student Projects
</h2>

<hr>
<p>
Each student began a research project during the two-week workshop.
Below are brief descriptions and links to these various projects.
The expectation is that these projects will form the basis for dissertation
chapters and/or journal articles.
<p>
Given the ambitious nature of the projects, this page is likely to change
over the next few months as projects reach completion over the summer.

Susan Bennet, Simon Fraser University
<p>
Susan is analyzing the adaptive dynamics invoked by various selection
mechanisms on a simple model of technological information sharing.
She has found that simple changes in selection algorithms can alter
the phase-space of the dynamics in such a way that very different 
compositions of final strategies emerge in the system.

John Cheng, UM-Ann Arbor
<p>
John is formally modeled the strategic dynamics of coordination
games like those discussed in Schelling and Arthur.  He has found
that the dynamics tend to promote ``inferior'' equilibria in these
games.

<p>
Barry Feldman, SUNY-Stonybrook
<p>
Barry is investigating coalition formation in cooperative games.
He is finding that the introduction of boundedly rational agents
into such an environment results in new notions of coalition formation
that, in many cases, allow very reasonable solutions to form.  Such
solutions can also be closely linked to some important existing notions
of rational coalition formation.

Nicholas Feltovich, University of Pittsburgh
<p>
Nick is investigating the simple adaptive dynamics of coordination
games like those discussed in Schelling and Arthur.  He will also be
conducting laboratory experiments on these games.

<p>
Michael Herron, Stanford 
<p>
Michael is using a genetic algorithm to find useful predictive patterns 
within voting data. Such nonlinear techniques may serve as a superior
alternative to many existing statistical techniques.

<hr>
<p>
Robert Hoffman, University of East Anglia, England
<p>
Robert is exploring the dynamics of locally connected agents playing
the repeated Prisoner's dilemma.  By adjusting both neighborhood size
of interactions and adaptation, he is finding a variety of interesting
results concerning the strategic dynamics of the system.

<hr>
<p>
David Kane, Harvard University
<p>
David is investigating the dynamics of legislative processes.

Steven McCarroll, Brookings
<p>
Steve has developed a model in which agents desire a status good in
which their utility is derived by their consumption of a necessary good 
(e.g., food) and their <em> relative rank </em> in consumption of the 
status good with respect to their neighbors (e.g., vacations).  Early
investigations indicate that the system can easily cycle with a series
of arms races forming and then slowly desolving.

<hr>
<p>
Kieron Meagher, Yale
<p>
Kieron has begun to explore a model of competing organizations.
Organizations can alter their structure so as to become more 
accurate information processors at the cost of increased processing
time.  

<hr>
<p>
Elizabeth Newlon, GSIA-CMU
<p>
Elizabeth is exploring the dynamics of simple general equilibrium
models using ``tunably-rational'' agents.  While such agents do
converge on Pareto optimal allocations, the resulting end points
are far from the competitive equilibrium.  She is current investigating
the underlying factors responsible for this behavior.

<hr>
<p>
Jordan Rappoport, Harvard University
<p>
Jordan is analyzing adaptive models of voting behavior when
special interests can influence parties and preferences.

<hr>
<p>
Michael Ryall, UCLA
<p>
Michael is studying the generic behavior of boundedly rational 
agents attempting to optimize payoff on complex problem spaces.  He
has shown how search across such a space can be modeled by a Markov process.
Current work focuses on finding the full implications of such an
analysis.

<hr>
<p>
Joel Schwartzbart, UC Irvine
<p>
Joel has developed a model of trade across a geographic space
in which endogenous trade networks can spontaneously form
and dissolve.
