Student Projects
</h2>

<p>
Each student began a research project during the two-week workshop.
Below are brief descriptions and links to these various projects.
The expectation is that these projects will form the basis for dissertation
chapters and/or journal articles.
<p>
Given the ambitious nature of the projects, this page is likely to change
over the next few months as projects reach completion.

<h4> 
Todd Allen, Johns Hopkins University
</h4>
<p>
Todd is investigating the effectiveness of monitoring for resolving
social dilemmas.  Agents, for example, employees in a
worker-managed firm, are allowed to monitor the effort level
of other agents, and payoffs to all agents are based on these observations.
Agents adaptively modify their monitoring strategies, and questions
concerning the emergence of cooperation in such situations are analyzed.

<h4> 
Tomas Bok, Harvard
</h4>
<p>
Tom has created a general "artificial worlds" engine to explore issues
of cooperation and altruism.  Using this engine he is currently exploring 
issues of selective interaction among cooperative agents.  In this model, agents
alter their desired level of global interaction as well as direct connections
with other agents through a process of learning and mutation.

<h4> 
Kim-Sau Chung, U. of Wisconsin--Madison 
</h4>
<p>
Kim-Sau is exploring how systems react to ambiguous news about the state
of a system.  For example, the impact of a coup on a country's economy or, say,
the release of unanticipated earnings news are likely to signal a large change
in the environment, yet the actual magnitude of this change may be ambiguous.
Using a dynamic mathematical model, Kim-Sau models both the waiting and learning
processes inherent in such events.

<h4> 
<a href="http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~dworman">
Garett Dworman</a>, U. of Penna--Wharton 
</h4>
<p>
Garett has developed a simple platform for investigating credit
allocation mechanisms.  This project is motivated by a larger on-going
research program investigating artificial adaptive negotiation agents
which are driven by sets of possibly incomplete and inconsistent
rules-of-thumb in a classifier system design.  Unfortunately,
classifier systems are notoriously poor performers due in part to
difficulties with the bucket brigade credit allocation mechanism.
This project's goal is to investigate and compare the isolated effects
of various credit allocation mechanisms on a very simple (but
scalable) problem.

<h4> 
Jorge Galindo-Flores, Harvard
</h4>
<p>
Jorge is analyzing different models of foreign exchange rate bands through
Monte Carlo methods.  This analysis will allow him to clarify the links
between the theoretical models and the empirical findings. By constructing
a FX model laboratory, he can begin to explore some normative issues
across the models, for example, adaptive models of bank intervention
policies can be analyzed.

<h4> 
Carl Hirschman, UC--Irvine
<a href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/irons/irons.html">
</h4>
<p>
Carl has begun to explore issues of learning in overlapping generation models
using simple ecologies of agents.   This work complements the existing work
of learning in these models, and provides a means by which to generate a number
of new and test a variety of existing hypotheses.  His current focus is on
competition among forecasting rules of various degrees of sophistication.

<h4> 
John Irons</a>, MIT
</h4>
<p>
John is focusing on models of party competition where citizens abstain
from voting when either party platforms are too far away from the
voter's ideal point or when parties have closely matched (in terms of
voter's utility) platforms.  He finds that such abstention dramatically
alters the form of the electorial landscape, and may lead to multiple
equilibria and unusual adaptive dynamics.

<p>
<h4> 
P. Konstantina Kiousis and
Benedikt Stefansson, UC--Los Angeles
</h4>
<p>
Konstantina and Benedikt have created a model of industry competition using
the Swarm platform.  Their model incorporates ideas about learning-by-doing, 
entry and exit dynamics, and product differentiation in attribute space.

<hr>
<p>
<h4> 
Scott de Marchi, U. of North Carolina
</h4>
<p>
Scott is studying models of adaptive party competition.  His initial
work has focused on allowing voters to pay attention to various aspects
of each party's platform.  Voters are allowed to adaptively choose which
issues to focus on, while simultaneously parties alter their platforms
to capture votes.  Current extensions include allowing parties to focus
voter attention on particular issues through political "advertising."

<h4> 
Mariana Mazzucato, The New School
</h4>
<p>
Mariana is exploring some fundamental issues in industrial organization.
Using a reduced form model of market share dynamics based on a replicator
equation, she is analyzing the dynamics implied by various cost conditions.
Along with the computational exploration of the model, she is also developing
two complementary mathematical approaches.

<hr>
<p>
<h4> 
Martin Posch, U. of Vienna
</h4>
<p>
Martin is analyzing learning in repeated games, through the use of an adaptive
aspiration model.  Agents maintain their past action in the game as long as 
their aspirations are met, however, when payoffs fall below aspiration levels
they alter their play.  Initial work on the repeated Prisoner's dilemma
indicates that the above model results in some interesting dynamics.

<hr>
<p>
<h4> 
Thor Sigvaldason, London School of Economics 
<a href="http://www.nd.edu/~mweagle/index.html">
</h4>
<p>
Thor is investigating trade (based on a model by Diamond) under adaptive
agents relying on finite automata rules.  Such a model has many interesting
implications vis-a-vis traditional methods.  The model also offers a variety
of new analytic possibilities, for example, the analysis of strategic complexity.

<hr>
<p>
<h4> 
Matt Weagle</a>, University of Notre Dame
</h4>
<p>
Matt is probing the dynamics of market stucture and formation.  
In his model, agents search and establish relationships with different
vendors, and in the process create a network of marker interactions.

<hr>
<p>
<h4> 
Yury Yegorov, European University Institute
</h4>
<p>
Yury is studying the dynamics of spatial infrastructure formation.
He has developed a model in which the self-organization of spatial
infrastructure can be analyzed. 

<hr>
<p>
<h4> 
Eduardo Zambrano, Cornell
</h4>
<p>
Eduardo is finding connections between the "El Farol" problem and game
theoretic results on learning in games.  Using these connections, he
has begun to provide a variety of new theoretical insights into the basic
problem.

<hr>
<p>
<h4> 
Jose S. Penalva Zuasti, UC--Los Angeles
</h4>
<p>
Jose has created a general equilibrium model where self-interested market-makers
drive the formation of new markets.
