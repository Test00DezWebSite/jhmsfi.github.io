  <p>We provide a simple model that simulates the ranking of a cycle race. Our 
    cyclists have bounded rationality and simple cycling rules that result in 
    interesting and realistic looking ranking dynamics. Cyclists end up clustering 
    together into groups, with the fastest cyclists forging ahead of their competitors. 
    Cyclists begin with randomly given stamina and energy levels, and reciprocation 
    is assumed. A Java program of our model is available as two files (<a href="ListMembers.java.txt" target="_blank" > 1</a>) 
    and (<a href="lance.java.txt" target="_blank" > 2</a>).</p>
  <h2><b>I. Model and Key Assumptions:</b></h2>
  <p>Each agent has a comfort speed at which they can remain in a steady state, 
    without tiring or reducing their energy stock.  All cyclists want to ride 
    at a speed that doesn’t draw down their energy during the race but stay as 
    far towards the front of the race as possible.  Stores of energy are desired 
    at the end when they deplete them to sprint to the finish line.  Energy is 
    a function of comfort speed CS, stock of energy E, and position <span>a</span> 
    and try to keep dE/dt = 0.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>E = f( CS, E, </i><i><span>a</span>)</i></p>
  <p>The specifications of our model are:</p>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>20 Cyclists that take turns in deciding their speed asynchronously.</li>
    <li>Race space is flexible - range is from last cyclist to first cyclist, 
      the finish is always far away.</li>
    <li>Each cyclist can decide to race at actual speeds S[t] at time t of 
      <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>1= Slow speed<br>
        2 = Medium speed<br>
        3 = Fast speed<br>
        4 = Very Fast speed<br>
        5 = Breakneck speed </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Speed is represented by each cyclist moving S spaces ahead, in their turn.</li>
    <li>Each agent has a randomly endowed comfort speed CS <span>~</span> {1,2,3}.  
      This is the speed at which a <i>lone</i> rider has constant energy levels.</li>
    <li>Each agent has an initial endowment of energy E[0] ~U[1,20]</li>
    <li>Energy level E[t] of each cyclist is dependent the previous energy level, 
      how fast they are going S[t], relative to their nominal comfort speed CS, 
      and their position in the pack at <i>a[t]</i> which determines their real 
      comfort speed level.</li>
  </ul>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Along with energy values, agents <b>use local information</b> from the 
      cyclists directly in front of them and behind them to make their relative 
      speed decision: speed up, stay at the same speed or slow down.  The value 
      of alpha represents the extra momentum given to a cyclist depending on their 
      position relative to other cyclists. The leader uses additional information, 
      looking behind him calculating how many cyclists <i>n </i>are benefiting 
      from his draft.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>
<h4><b>Sequence of Movements</b></h4>
  <p> Cyclists take their turn in deciding their speed.  The order of sequence 
    is from the front rider to the last, in each round.  Their decision choice 
    is based on their position, energy levels and surrounding agent speed levels.<span style='font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;;
display:none;'></span></p>
  <p>Each cyclist has the same goals:<span style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'></span></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>be close to the front to beat as many other 
      cyclists as possible</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>have more <b>energy </b>for the final sprint 
      than other cyclists</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>group membership affects chances of winning, 
      utility gains through stockpiling energy so reciprocity assumed. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>Each cyclist has the same speed decision dependent 
  on their position at time t.</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'></div>
</blockquote>
<div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'> 
  <ul type=disc>
    <li><b>Loner </b>will decide his speed first based on the speed of the agent 
      in front of him – 2 or more spaces away. If his CS+1 is greater than or 
      equal to the agent in front’s speed, then sprint ahead to catch up with 
      the group, else look at the cyclist behind them.  If the loner’s CS+1 is 
      greater than the speed of the agent behind, then they remain a loner. If 
      they are running out of energry (E&lt;1) they slow down by 1 each period 
      until they can reach a group to renew their energy.</li>
    <li><b>Followers</b>, cyclists who are behind another cyclist, have an increasing 
      energy of 0.2 per turn, because their energy levels are given a boost from 
      the draft.  They choose to travel at CS+1</li>
    <li><b>Leaders</b>, that agent which is out in front, depletes their energy 
      losing 0.5 per turn and also choose to travel at CS+1.  If the leader remains 
      at the front of the group, he does so basing his decision on reciprocity 
      in relation to the other free riders in his group.   He will decide to stay 
      in front drawing down his energy by E[t]/n[t].  At this point he will decide 
      to slow down and move only CS spaces ahead, with the cyclist behind him 
      becoming the new leader. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus the simple heuristics of our model are:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>Tired?  Stay with the group or slow down <span
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'></span></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>Member of a group?  Move at comfort speed 
      + 1 and recharge. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>Do “fair share” of leading:  lead until I’ve 
      sacrificed 1/(#group members) of my energy; then slow to CS</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>Alone? look for advantageous groups to join 
      in the range of the right speed.  Feasible groups ahead are preferred to 
      groups behind.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'> 
  <p>We expect that agents with the same comfort speeds will group together and 
    race at a group speed of CS+1, with cooperation taking place where each agent 
    takes their turn at being at the front.<sub></sub></p>
  <h2><b>II. Key Results:</b></h2>
  <p>We run a simulation of 100 time periods. Blank lines are gaps that occur 
    between cyclists with varying speeds.  Comfort speeds of our ranked agents 
    are presented in table 1.  Cyclists are sorted by their race rank from left 
    to right, with the fastest person on the far left.  Table 2 presents the changing 
    rank of our cyclists, which are assigned numbers 1 to 20.  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Actual Speed:</b></p>
  <p>-The group speed heuristic is active for almost every rider in almost every 
    turn since riders begin in a group; do much of their filtering still in a 
    big pack; and are already members of their final group by the time they break 
    away from the initial pack. This causes most riders to choose comfort_speed 
    + 1 in almost every turn.<br>
    -The next most important heuristic in choosing speeds is that group leaders 
    reduce their speeds when their energy level drops. This leads to people cycling 
    from the front to the back of their groups.<br>
    -The low energy heuristics and group joining heuristics are sometimes important.<br>
    -Sometimes the group speed heuristics and the group joining heuristics lead 
    to irrational &quot;yo-yo&quot; patterns where a fast leader uses the group 
    member heuristic to move at comfort speed +1 and breaks away from a slower 
    follower; only to drop back. An excerpt from a different simulation is presented 
    below, taken from periods 6-10, this &quot;yo-yo&quot; result happened to 
    the race leader before there was good sorting. The image for this example 
    shows each speed decision after it has had its effect.</p>

    the group again)
    4 _4 4 3 3 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 __3 3 2 _____2 2 2 2 1 (here, 4 leads him to break 
    away; meanwhile other fast guys have also passed the slow riders)
    4 4 2 3 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 __3 3 3 _______2 2 2 2 1 (here, choosing 2 lands him 
    in third since the fast riders pass him when he slows down)

  </pre>
  <p><b>Comfort Speed:</b></p>
  <p>These heuristics lead to a general and rapid sorting by comfort speed in 
    <a href="comfort.txt" target="_blank" > table 1</a> where the first line are the initial ordering:</p>
  <p>After the first decisions, comfort speeds are fairly randomly distributed, 
    where initial ordering and time period 1 are shown below:<br>
  </p>
  <p>2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 3 1 3<br>
    2 2 2 2 _2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 3 1 3 1 1</p>
  <p>By the 14th time period, this run led to perfect sorting and significant 
    clustering by comfort speed.</p>
  <p>3 3 3 __3 _3 2 2 2 2 ____2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 __________1 1 1</p>
  <p> However, there can be cases when the sorting is slightly imperfect. In the 
    example below, from a different simulation, there was a similar random order 
    in the first turn; by the 11th time period, there was almost perfect sorting, 
    except that an actor with a comfort speed of 2 is leading the group of people 
    with comfort speeds of 1. An examination of the energy data shows that he 
    has low energy. His tired of leading heuristic seems to have been activatived, 
    which has slowed him to his comfort speed which is the same as the followers' 
    group speed (comfort_speed +1).</p>
  <p>2 2 1 3 3 3 2 1 1 3 2 3 1 3 2 3 3 2 3 3<br>
    3 3 3 3 ____3 3 ___3 3 3 3 2 2 ___2 2 2 ___2 1 1 1 1</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Jockying for Position:</b></p>
  <p>Agents become ranked by comfort speed quite early, and teamwork rotation 
    occurs with each pack. Looking at the rank of cyclists in <a href="rider.txt" target="_blank" > ID 
    table 3</a> we can see a very realistic teamwok formation within each pack. 
    If one looks at the end of our time series all three packs have the leader 
    slowing down and falling to the back of the pack, and riders rotating through 
    the pack to maximize group speed and energy levels. This can be seen when 
    comparing IDs with energy from <a href="energy.txt" target="_blank" >  table 4</a> listed for 
    each cyclist in each period. The leader of a pack slows down to his comfort 
    speed, moves to the back of the pack and then regains speed and energy to 
    keep with the pack benefiting from the draft created by the bike rider in 
    front of them. As the next leader does the same, each follower moves up one 
    position through the pack each time period.</p>
  <p>In another simulation that we ran, we have the interesting phenomenon of 
    the trailing pack having a cyclist with comfort speed 2 leading the pack. 
    This allows followers behind him to stay in their same sequence and free ride 
    off the leader. Unfortunately, for this leading cyclist, he did not catch 
    up with the faster speed group in time.</p>
  <p>The position of a cyclists within his pack, is more constant the smaller 
    the pack, easily seen in comparing the groups coming second and third. A smaller 
    group In the pack coming last cyclists change leadership every time period. 
    In the middle pack with the much larger group of </p>
  <p>In our simulation at line 12, we can see that a gap opens up as the leading 
    pack with the faster speed breaks away, forming a gap between the leading 
    pack and cyclist number 20, who has a medium comfort speed of 2. Cyclists 
    1 and 3 further back, have fast comfort speeds and come up through the pack 
    to overtake the leader - cyclist 20. They must sprint to catch up with the 
    leading pack, increasing their <a href="actual_speed.txt" target="_blank" > speeds</a> to breakneck 
    speed and depleting their <a href="energy.txt" target="_blank" > energy</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Cyclist Energy Levels:</b></p>
  <p>Cyclist lose energy as they become leaders and then gain energy as they move 
    to the back of the feild, slowing down for one period to CS which takes them 
    to the back of the pack and then returning to CS+1 in the pack.</p>
  <p>Cyclist number 1 came from the very <a href="rider.txt" target="_blank" > back of the pack</a>, 
    last in the starting line, with a randomly selected energy level of 13 units 
    and comfort speed of fast. By the time he makes his way up to the leading 
    pack, having to sprint between packs, his energy is now down to 3.5. Eventually 
    he takes his turn at the <a href="rider.txt" target="_blank" > lead</a> and by the end of our 
    simulation he has an energy of 16.1 units. If the size of our bicycle race 
    was larger, then one being able to catch up to the front pack, which is increasingly 
    getting away, may not be possible, e.g if cyclist number 1's energy had run 
    out to 1 before reaching the leading pack. This happened in other simulations 
    that we performed, and it results in the faster rider leading a slower pack, 
    with no teamwork involved, all riders behind him can afford to be complete 
    free riders, and attempts to break away from the pack usually lead in the 
    decline in energy and then return to the slower pack.</p>
  <h2><b>III. Possible Future Directions:</b></h2>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>We could extend this model by adding greedy agents who choose not to lead, 
      along with the reciprocating agents currently included.</li>
    <li>Cyclists with large accumulating energy levels might decide to sprint 
      ahead and join a group riding at CS+2 for a time period until his energy 
      stock falls below a certain level and then he will move back to join his 
      original slower group, or ride as a loner.</li>
    <li>Energy levels could be made into real numbers instead of natural numbers.</li>
    <li>The range of comfort levels could be increased</li>
    <li>Distance from the leader might also be taken into account</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>IV. Applications to other social science processes</h2>
  <p>The two primary features of this model are variable transaction costs depending 
    on ones relation to other agents, free riding, the provision of a public good 
    or positive externality through intentional or unintentional cooperative behavior, 
    and fragile alliances.  Some examples of how such a process may be applicable 
    to social sciences include:<span
style='display:none;'></span></p>
  <h3>Innovation</h3>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>There may be excessive startup costs to innovating a new product, but 
      once it has begun, it may generate spin offs through information and increasing 
      skill base of workers, leading to declining costs for those that follow. 
      <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'></div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>
  <div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>
    <p>E.g. Government innovation of the internet, for its own interest, and for 
      the public good. Pharmaceutical Companies, with a large stock of cash (energy) 
      can afford to invest in high costs research, with expected future payoffs.  
      Other companies that follow in producing generic drugs can profit later.</p>
    
  </div>
</div>
<div style='layout-grid:18.0pt'>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Entrepreneur e.g. Bill Gates, might have initial 
    large stock pile of intelligence or cash, and can hop from group to group 
    restoring energy each period, giving spin offs to others, eventually becoming 
    the leader of the pack, and he may even decide to pull away from the pack 
    (form a monopoly) if his comfort speed is higher than everyone elses, therefore 
    denying his intellectual property to others, removing his public good.</p>
  <h3>Team work</h3>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Union protests. One person has to risk the initiation of a protest and 
      may get punished for his individual action by the employer, but if enough 
      other workers strike or protest along with him for the same benefits, then 
      as a group they will gain and individual won’t be punished.  </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>It may be that some peoples comfort level to never cause trouble, others 
      might be inclined to initiate trouble, and others might be indifferent, 
      but can be persuaded to join if the costs of doing over the long run are 
      low compared to the returns.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Army formation, attacking an enemy on the ground, front line may be rotated 
      back.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Political formation where ‘comfort speed’ is endogenous.  Eg. Ralph Nader’s, 
      political bid, leads to his own considerable transaction costs to increase 
      his support base. But each year green or independent parties are increasing.  
      Ralph might ultimately use up all his energy and fall back but a new reenergized 
      leader can take his place.<span style='display:none;'></span></li>
