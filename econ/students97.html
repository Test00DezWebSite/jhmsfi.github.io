<h3>
1997 Graduate Workshop in Computational Economics

This year we had over 40 very well focused
applicants for the available spaces.  The quality of all these applications
was very high.  Over the past few years we have found that the workshop is much
more productive when we can identify students with interests that easily overlap
with one another.  If you did not get in to the workshop, it was most likely because
we were unable to identify this overlap, and not because we felt your skills
or project had little potential.  Please feel free to apply to next year's
workshop, and in the interim 
keep in touch with us and the web site to try and enhance
your research.
