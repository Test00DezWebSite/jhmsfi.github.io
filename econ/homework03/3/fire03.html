<p><tt>WHAT IS IT?<BR>-----------<BR>This project simulates the spread of a fire through a room.<BR><BR><BR>HOW TO USE IT<BR>-------------<BR>Click the SETUP button to set up the people (multi-colored) and fire (red on the left-hand side).<BR><BR>Click the GO button to start the simulation.  The simulation will stop when all possible squares have burned.<BR><BR>Click the STEP button to execute one step of the model.<BR><BR>Click the BATCH-RUN button to execute the model for length-of-runs timesteps, number-of-runs, this is the only button which will update average-dead-people.<BR><BR>THINGS TO NOTICE<BR>----------------<BR>The blue "walls" prevent the fire from spreading off the edges of the screen.  The fire spreads with rate fireSpread, which can be controlled by the slider.  Agents are initially scattered randomly across the grid and remain stationary unless they are next to a fire or they have been yelled at or nudged (as explained below).  If they know there is a fire in the room, then they move directly towards the exit, unless the fire stands in their way, in which case they turn to the right 10 degrees and try and move in that direction.  This continues for a full circle, if they are surrounded by the fire they remain stationary.<BR><BR>Number-of-runs controls the number of times the model is run when the BATCH-RUN button is pressed.<BR><BR>Length-of-runs controls the number of steps the model is executed for when BATCH-RUN is pressed.<BR><BR>If Conisderate-people? is turned on, then agents will either Yell or Nudge other agents to let them know a fire is coming.<BR><BR>If Yell? is turned on and Considerate-people? is turned on then agents set a variable in the current patch, called fire-coming to 1 and this variable diffuses throughout the grid.<BR><BR>If Yell? is turned off but Considerate-people? is turned on then agents will nudge any agents that they pass by (are in the same patch) on their way to the exit.<BR><BR>Dead-people is the number of agents that have been consumed by the fire.<BR><BR>Avg-dead-people is the average over multiple runs and is only calculated when the batch-run button is pressed.<BR><BR>EXTENDING THE MODEL<BR>-------------------<BR><BR>NETLOGO FEATURES<BR>-----------------<BR><BR>CREDITS AND REFERENCES<BR>----------------------<BR>Based on the forest fire model developed by Resnick and WIlensky, as listed below.<BR><BR>This model was developed at the MIT Media Lab. See Resnick, M. (1994) "Turtles, Termites and Traffic Jams: Explorations in Massively Parallel Microworlds." Cambridge, Ma: MIT Press. Adapted to StarLogoT, 1997, as part of the Connected Mathematics Project.
