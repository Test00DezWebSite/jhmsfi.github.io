<P>
We study the process of ovation that eventually takes place after a good
play in a theater or after an interesting lecture. This process is
essentially dynamic, and includes interaction not only between the artist or
lecturer and the audience, but also within the audience. Therefore, the
description of different types of agents who form an audience, and the
interaction between them, conform the core assumptions of the model.
<P>
Different agents perceive the same lecture in a different way, and they also
put different weights on the behaviour of their neighbours and of the whole
auditorium. In general, people do not like to reveal their preferences in
public, especially if they are very different from the average. That is why
the decision of those who start clapping is the most difficult. They really
want to be sure that they want to do it even if the whole hall remains
silent. This effect produces nonlinear relationship between the real quality
of lecture, and the applause, which, though observable, cannot be used as an
adequate measure of the quality of the lecture or play.
<P>
In our model we try to make a distinction between simple clapping and
ovation, which includes also standing up. A person, ceterus paribus, should
get higher utility from the lecture or play if he/she not only claps, but
also stands, and the lecture or play is perceived as very good.
<P>
Though it is possible to model just a binary decision between clapping and
not clapping at each moment of time for a particular person just by
considering whether some sort of utility is above a threshold point, we want
to proceed in a different way. On the one hand, the threshold has been made
endogenous, so to speak, for the individual compares the utility of clapping
to that of not clapping, which depends on a number of arguments that vary
with time. On the other, one version of our model considers mapping (in a
sigmoid fashion) the utilities derived from the different actions to the
probabilities that such actions are indeed chosen by the individuals. We
also consider the analytics of a case in which it is the case that the
reservation utility of clapping is determined outside the model.
<P>
The process of clapping also has a dynamics at the individual level intended
to capture such an effect as tiredness from clapping, which also depends on
overall reaction of the hall.
<P>
This model, being rather general, is a bit complicated . Thus, we make
several simplifications to our general model and report computational
experiments for particular specifications of some functions and parameters.
