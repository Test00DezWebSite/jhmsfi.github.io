INFORMATION IMPEDIMENTS MATTER?</b><p>
<b></b><i>by Todd Allen, Konstantina Kiousis, Mariana Mazzucato, and Martin
Posch</i><p>

<b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
The following model considers the role of information impediments in
influencing outcomes.  Agents are endowed with a prior position regarding an
issue, a proclivity towards activity or passivity (a risk-aversion parameter),
and limited information regarding the activity of other agents.  We assume that
agents' vision is obstructed by active agents and that signals from <i>recent
</i>activity are weighted heavier by agents than past activity.   We also
assume a hierarchical structure of the population in which those who are more
infantile (those seated in front in the standing ovation application) are more
visible to the population as a whole. This causes the influential group to be
unaffected by the less influential agents.<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>THE MODEL</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
Agents are positioned on an <i>n</i> x <i>m</i> lattice, where each agent is
situated at integer coordinates.  The position of the kth agent is denoted by
{ik, jk}.  At the initial state of the world each agent is endowed with a level
of agreement towards an exogenous event, Sk (0,1) and a degree of risk
aversion, k (0,1), where 1 k  n x m.<p>
<p>
We assume that an agent's decision rules are governed by her initial position
and her tendency to conform. A higher degree of risk aversion implies a higher
degree of conformity.  We assume discrete time steps and that each agent begins
in a passive state.<p>
<p>
Consider an agent k at time t. Let zk be the agent's state; it is equal to 1 if
she is active, and 0 if she is passive.  She receives a signal from every other
agent l  with probability lk, where l  k.  lk is a measure of agent k's
visibility of agent l. This visibility depends on the number of obstructions
between l and k, where the obstructions are the other agents located between
them. The visibility behind each agent is 0.  We experiment with the assumption
that the active agents pose a greater obstruction than the passive agents. <p>
<p>
Besides the signals sent between agents there is also an external initial
signal sent to the agent from the environment at t=0 (in the model below it is
represented by the  initial satisfaction with the lecture). <p>
<p>
 If agent k receives a signal, then with probability s she reacts to the
signal.  If the signal is positive she increases zk  by 1 while if it is
negative she decreases it by 1. This process is applied to all signals sent by
agents.  If zk &gt; 0 then the agent becomes/ remains active, otherwise she
becomes/remains passive. We experiment with the assumption that the strength of
the signal sent by an agent who has just become active/passive is stronger than
that sent by an agent who was already active/passive.  These differential
strengths are represented by weights (see below).<p>
 <p>
The probabilities of updating z are given in the following table:<p>

  <p>
and a (p) is the obstruction an active (passive) agent represents. <p>
 `Recent Active' means that the agent who sends the signal just became active
as opposed to being already being active which instead we denote by `Past
Active'. The weights wP, wR, and wI are the strengths of the signals .<p>
<p>
We note that the updating process is not synchronous but stochastic. It is not
however   completely random: if much activity occurs on the lattice an agent is
more likely to update.  This is a type of  incentive-based updating.  The model
may also be seen as a neural net with a stochastic firing mechanism.   In this
context, every agent represents a neuron which is interconnected with all
others and the probabilities replace the weights one finds in a neural net. <p>
<p>
<b><u>Results</u></b><p>
We programmed the model in  Visual Basic, and ran the simulations with a
lattice size of 10 x 10 and an average simulation time of 50 time periods.  We
obtained the following results:<p>
<p>
Assuming a high initial satisfaction of agents, both with and without
obstruction, most agents become active. However, when the level of obstruction
is high, agents take a <i>longer </i>time to become active. Once they are
active they remain active since they do not receive the signals of the passive
agents which would be visible if there were no obstructions. <p>
<p>
On the other hand, when obstructions are not included in the model, agents tend
to shift from an active to a passive position. <p>
<p>
When initial satisfaction is low, no agent action occurs whether or not
obstructions exist.<p>
<p>
When recent actions are weighted more than past actions, a `domino' effect
emerges where one action of one agent induces the `action' of many agents.   <p>
<p>
We note that the hierarchical structure of the population causes activity to
not be propagated in a forward direction.<p>
<p>
<b><u>EXAMPLE  1:  STANDING OVATION</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>Consider the case of a standing ovation.  The "active" behavior
described in the above model represents `standing' for an ovation at the end of
a performance, and `passive' behavior represents `sitting' at the end of a
performance.  An obstruction is interpreted as a person standing between the
agent and the sent signal.  The agent weights the signal from an agent who has
just stood up/sat down more than a signal from an agent who has already been
standing/sitting.  The motivation behind this assumption is the idea that
humans tend to value immediate actions more than old ones due to decay in the
memory. <b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>EXAMPLE  2:  POLITICAL ACTIVITIES</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>Consider the case of public activism concerning political issues.
A common criticism of the American political system has been the apathy of its
citizens in voicing their stance on a variety of political topics.  This
vexation has raised questions with regards to what barriers might hinder
participation in agenda setting.  The large size of the US population, the
small commitment of individuals to the political process, the risk-aversion of
individuals in voicing their opinions, and the alienation of some voters due to
lack of information regarding issues have all been cited as possible barriers
to political activity.  These issues have to some extent been explored in the
model presented above.  We depict a process of coalition formation, where
public activism is stimulated or hindered.  Of particular concern, and a novel
feature of this study, was the role of information obstruction in stimulating
or discouraging activism. Information impediments are created by the more
active agents impeding the flow of information to the less active agents.
Consider the case of the fundamentalist Christian right whose activism
overshadows the flow of information from the less active majority.   <p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u>Extensions</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>Parameters which could be varied in the model to study the
different qualitative results include:<p>
a) changing the shape and size of the auditorium. <p>
b) including clusters of agents , where some clusters have a stronger strength
in attracting standing behavior than others. For example we might assume that
students value a standing professor more than a standing student in their value
for alpha. <p>
c) changing  the mean and variance of the initial distribution of satisfaction
with the lecture.<p>
d) including an aisle could significantly effect results due to the altered
line of visibility.   We may also include `exit' and assume that those agents'
seated closest to the aisle are most likely to leave.<p>
