<P>
We want to highlight the main features of our model of clapping and ovation:
(i) the presence of a measure of quality of the play or lecture that is
perceived differently by each individual, (ii)the presence of differenciated
effects of the behavior of the individuals in small neighborhoods and in the
entire hall on the behavior of the agents, (iii) the fact that individuals
have a fairly good measure of the level of clapping that takes place in
their environment but an imperfect measure on the number of people who are
actually standing, which is based on their visual field, (iv) the fact that
agents form their expectations adaptively, that is, by a weighted average
between past aggregate expectations and actions, and (v) that individuals
will feel less reward from clapping and standing after having done so for a
certain amount of time, which actually depends on the behavior of others.
Within this framework, and without any assumption requesting that the
crucial type of people be seated at places that are more conducive to
'seeding' the process of clapping and ovation, we generate fairly robust and
rugged ovations under a wide variety of the parameters that define the
landscape of preferences. The results encourage us to find applications of
these type of models to processes of technological diffusion and
obsolesence.
