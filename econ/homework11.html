<h2> Field of dreams </h2>

<p>
Consider the following situation:

<p>

Academics choose research topics.  

<p>
<nl>
<li>
Model, using whatever techniques you wish, the above scenario.
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Explicitly state your model and key assumptions.
   <li> Summarize key results.
   <li> Suggest some potentially interesting future directions and
questions for the model.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Suggest some standard social science scenarios that could be
usefully modeled using such a process.
