  Isaac Sasson and Trey Thomas</h2>

  <h2 class="c0">Scenario</h2>

  <p class="c0">People in different parts of a country, and across countries, begin
  to want a change in government.</p>

  <h2 class="c0">Conceptual Framework</h2>

  <p class="c0">We approach this modeling scenario from the perspective that
  country-level factors play a role in shaping the development of revolution among
  individual citizens. &nbsp;We imagine that a country generally predisposed to
  opposition (from a history of oppression, perhaps) is more likely to suffer from
  revolution than one historically predisposed to loyalty. &nbsp;Revolution, we suggest,
  is dependent on a long history of preceding events and so we account for differences in
  such predispositions across countries. &nbsp;</p>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0">Additionally, we imagine that the density of a country&rsquo;s
  population can moderate the extent to which loyalty or opposition views spread.
  &nbsp;While a very sparsely populated country would likely rise in opposition only when
  individuals are generally predisposed to revolution, a massively dense population may
  be more susceptible to rapid increases in opposition as communication among neighbors
  is commonplace.</p>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0">Lastly, we imagine the process by which a desire for a change in
  government develops over time at the individual-level - conditioned on the views of
  one&rsquo;s neighbors. &nbsp;Given our focus on country-level predispositions, it
  follows that an individual would consider the views of his/her neighborhood relative to
  the country at large. &nbsp;A moderate individual living in a moderate neighborhood in
  Country A, might be a moderate living in very extremism neighborhood in Country
  B.</p>

  <h2 class="c0"></a>The
  Model</h2>

  <p class="c0">We envision revolutions developing across space - both nationally
  and internationally. Therefore, we start with four countries in a 2x2 grid. The
  countries are all equally-sized, with each able to populate up to 2,500 individuals.
  Since space is fixed within each country, changing the population size in effect
  determines the country&rsquo;s population density.</p>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><b>Assumptions:</b></p>

    <li>Individuals are randomly placed in space and their location
    remains fixed over time.</li>

    <li>Individual support for revolution is measured on a continuous
    scale from -10 to 10, where 10 is highly supportive of the revolution, 0 is neutral,
    and -10 is highly opposing the revolution (i.e., supportive of the current
    regime).</li>

    <li>The initial level of individual support for revolution is
    drawn from a N(mu<sub>i</sub>, sd) distribution, where
    mu<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;is the mean national level of support
    in country<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;and&nbsp;sd
    reflects the initial heterogeneity in individuals&rsquo; support, which is constant
    across countries.</li>

    <li>In each time step, individuals update their level of support
    based on their position relative to neighbors in some radius, and how the
    neighborhood fares relative to the nation as a whole.</li>

    <li>If the mean national level of support crosses a threshold
    (e.g., 6), a revolution ensues.</li>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><b>Parameters:</b></p>

    <li>Population size (determines density) for each country: ranges
    from 0 to 2,500</li>

    <li>Initial mean national support (mu<sub>i</sub>): ranges from -5 to 5</li>

    <li>Radius of neighborhood: either 1 or 3</li>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><b>Rules for Interaction:</b></p>

  <p class="c0">Although support is measured on a continuous scale (at both the
  individual and national levels), we introduce the binary construct of extreme vs.
  moderate individuals/neighborhoods. Individuals are considered moderate if they are
  within one standard deviation (defined in starting conditions) of their neighborhood
  mean; otherwise they are considered extremists, either supporting the revolution or
  opposing it (i.e., strongly supporting current government). Similarly, neighborhoods
  are considered moderate if they are within one standard deviation from the national
  mean level of support for the revolution; otherwise, they are considered extreme. With
  this formulation, individuals act based on their position relative to the neighborhood,
  which in term is defined in relation to the national mean level of support.</p>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><i>Between individuals (within country) rules:</i></p>

  <p class="c0">If neighborhood is moderate relative to national
    mean:</p>


    <li>Moderate individual -&gt; stay the same</li>

    <li>Extreme individual -&gt; become more moderate (multiply by
    [1-c])</li>

  <p class="c0">If neighborhood is extreme relative to national
    mean:</p>


    <li>Moderate individual -&gt;move toward neighborhood mean (add
    the difference between individual and neighborhood support multiplied by
    [c])</li>

    <li>Extreme individual -&gt; become more extreme (multiply by
    [1+c])</li>


  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><i>Between countries rule:</i></p>

  
    <li>If revolution occurs only Von Neumann neighbors are affected;
    a proportion <span class="c8">p&nbsp;of agents in those
    neighboring countries now become very extreme.</li>


  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0"><b>Constants:</b></p>

  
    <li>Threshold = 6</li>

    <li>sd = 0.5</li>

     <li>c = 0.2&nbsp;is the proportional
    change factor for individual becoming more moderate/extreme.</li>

     <li>p = 0.2&nbsp;is the proportion of
    extreme agents arising in adjacent countries following revolution.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="c0 c6"></p>

  <h2 class="c0">Results</h2>

  <p class="c0">The model can result in one of two outcomes for each state: either
  a revolution ensues or the population (not necessarily individuals) converges to some
  mean national level of support anywhere below the threshold. The following insights
  follow:</p>

    <li>Not surprisingly, all else being equal, &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;
    countries (mu<span class="c5">i&nbsp;= 0) tend to remain stable
    over time. Populations already predisposed toward support or opposition to revolution
    tend to become slightly more extreme in that direction, on average, but then
    stabilize too.</li>

    <li>Population density matters for promoting or inhibiting a
    revolution. Interestingly, this effect is moderated by neighborhood size. Large
    neighborhoods inhibit extremism (in either direction) in high-density populations,
    but foster extremism in low-density populations (and vice versa).</li>

    <li>Once a revolution occurs in one country it may propagate to
    adjacent countries, but only if they are moderately predisposed to revolution at the
    time. Otherwise, the disturbance will diminish and the population level of support
    will re-stabilize close to prior conditions.</li>

  <h2 class="c0">Interesting Future Directions</h2>

  <p class="c0">One foreseeable addition to our model would be the inclusion of
  government actors as agents in the model, who would seek to punish/imprison/attack
  individuals or neighborhoods that have extreme opposition views. &nbsp;For example, it
  would be possible to program a class of &lsquo;police&rsquo; agents to increase in
  number as the country mean approached higher levels of opposition, up to some threshold
  whereby the regime would &lsquo;run out of&rsquo; police reserves and suffer from
  revolution. &nbsp;How many would be needed, and in what force, would regime-backed
  police be able to sequester a regime? &nbsp;What population densities and
  predispositions of opposition could overcome even a well-entrenched
  government?</p>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0">A second, and visually appealing, addition would include the
  restructuring of the model&rsquo;s spatial landscape to better approximate the
  real-world. &nbsp;For example, our four country grid might be transformed into a five
  or six country &lsquo;continent&rsquo; wherein adjacency varied across the landscape.
  &nbsp;Would changing the spatial landscape (and potentially limiting, or increasing
  adjacencies) impact the spread of revolution across countries? &nbsp;What spatial
  configurations set the stage for a cascade of revolutions?</p>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <h2 class="c0">Application to
  Other Social Science Applications</h2>

  <p class="c0">Our model and approach may be useful for studying social science
  questions involving the propagation of an opinion, view, or behavior (measured on a
  continuous scale) among individuals within groups of individuals and subsequently
  across spatial units. &nbsp;The spread of pro-war sentiment, desire to mitigate carbon
  emissions, or even feelings of happiness could (potentially) be modeled given the
  above.</p>

  <p class="c6 c0"></p>

  <p class="c0">As an illustrative example, if a researcher was interested in the
  culture of graduate student cohorts within a university program our model would be
  easily applicable. &nbsp;Say that each cohort has a predisposition toward vigorous
  competition or collective solidarity among students, and that cohorts differed in their
  sizes. &nbsp;In the model, the competitiveness or solidarity of individual students
  would naturally adjust over time compared to other students around them, relative to the
  predisposition/mean of each cohort. &nbsp;Under what conditions would solidarity among
  graduate prevail over entrenched competition?</p>
