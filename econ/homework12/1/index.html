We decided to model the dynamics of political commitments following this intuition. What are the circumstances that might lead these indifferent agents to become politically active? We were also interested in capturing the way governments or regimes react to the growth of an opposition movement by using repressive tactics, which have the effect of discouraging undecided people from joining activist movements.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Assumptions</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1. We distinguish three types of agents: </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><ol class="c7" start="1"><li class="c6 c2"><span class="c0">Changers</span><span>. These are politically motivated, interested in social change, and want to recruit others to join them in initiatives to change the government. </span></li><li class="c2 c6"><span class="c0">Keepers</span><span>. These agents represent supporters of the establishment, and include civilians, law enforcers and government people. </span></li><li class="c6 c2"><span class="c0">Undecided</span><span>. These represent people who don&rsquo;t have strong political inclinations, who might be pro or against the government depending on particular circumstances, but are not naturally inclined to promote change. </span></li></ol><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>2. Agents have a &ldquo;Happiness Level&rdquo;. This value represents factors </span><span>such as </span><span>socio-economic status that influence how satisfied the agent feels in the society.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>3. The government reacts to the growth of changers by repressing them and supporting the keepers. We model a government&rsquo;s tendency to repress as a &ldquo;Political Enforcement Level&rdquo;. Different political regimes react more or less strongly based on this level.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>4. Agents have &ldquo;Neighbors&rdquo;. These represent other agents who can &ldquo;convince&rdquo; undecided agents to join their position. That is, following the influence of their neighbors, undecided agents can potentially become either changers or keepers.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Model </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The following UML diagram represents the main entities of the model, their attributes and main functions. The world consists of a set of countries and each country has a set of changers, keepers, and undecided agents. Each agent has a fixed number of neighbors. </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="453" src="images/image13.png" width="312"></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The type of each agent is assigned initially based on the </span><span>P</span><span>oliticalCommitment distribution of the country. To model the neighbors relations we use a lattice, as exemplified in the following figure:</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="308" src="images/image12.png" width="329"></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dynamics</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Let </span><span class="c1">L</span><span>&nbsp;be the lattice of agents, with Changers &sube; </span><span class="c1">L</span><span>&nbsp;and Keepers &sube; </span><span class="c1">L</span><span>&nbsp;and Undecided &sube; </span><span class="c1">L</span><span>. Every agent </span><span class="c1">i</span><span>&nbsp;has some commitment (i.e., </span><span class="c1">L</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img height="11" src="images/image09.png" width="10"><span>{</span><span class="c1">C</span><span>,</span><span class="c1">K</span><span>,</span><span class="c1">U</span><span>}).</span><span>&nbsp;Let </span><span class="c1">N</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>&nbsp;be the set of neighbors of </span><span class="c1">i</span><span>, and </span><span class="c1">c</span><span class="c1 c3">i</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1">k</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>&nbsp;be the number of changer neighbors and keeper neighbors of </span><span class="c1">i</span><span>&nbsp;respectively.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In each step of the simulation, we go around the set of Undecided, updating their political commitment. To do so, we first compute a reaction factor </span><span class="c1">r</span><span>, given by</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="17" src="images/image08.png" width="271"></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>This function captures the idea that the government reacts faster depending on its political enforcement, and reacts faster as the number of changers increases.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="276" src="images/image00.png" width="276"></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>Values of reaction factor r for different values of political enforcement </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>(green = 0.3; red = 0.6; blue = 1) plotted against relative amount of changers in the population. </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>There are three possible ways in which an agent can update her commitment. If </span><span class="c1">k</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>&nbsp;&gt; </span><span class="c1">c</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>, then</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="19" src="images/image07.png" width="279"></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>This means that if the agent is surrounded mostly by keepers, there is a certain probability that she is going to be influenced to be a keeper, which is determined by the proportion of keepers (i.e., </span><span class="c1">k</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>&#8725;4), her happiness, and the reaction of the government.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The second case is similar. If </span><span class="c1">k</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>&nbsp;&lt; </span><span class="c1">c</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>, then</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="19" src="images/image03.png" width="364"></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>which determines the probability of becoming a changer, depending on the proportion of changers, the unhappiness and the reactiveness of the government.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Finally, if </span><span class="c1">k</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>&nbsp;= </span><span class="c1">c</span><span class="c3 c1">i</span><span>, then the agent doesn&rsquo;t update her political commitment. This captures the intuition that an undecided person doesn&rsquo;t become less undecided if she is in a group in which opposing opinions are balanced. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>We implemented this model using R. The source code is available </span><span class="c9"><a class="c10" href="VoltaRomero-Solution.r">here</a></span><span>.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Results</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>For the purposes of the present exercise, we tested scenarios with only one country. We began exploring model behavior by running it with a uniform initial distribution of political commitment values (</span><span class="c1">C</span><span>, </span><span class="c1">K</span><span>, </span><span class="c1">U</span><span>), random distribution of agent happiness values, and testing over the range of values of political enforcement. As expected, the government reacts more strongly and more rapidly to the growth of changers with higher political enforcement values. In some cases, this can lead to a leveling off of the growth of the opposition movement, eventually reaching a stable state. Since the government reaction also acts to support the keepers movement, these tend to grow more rapidly at the same time as the growth of the changers is being slowed down. The success of the changers&rsquo; &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; thus depends on the interaction between political enforcement values and the initial relative quantities of </span><span class="c1">C</span><span>, </span><span class="c1">K</span><span>, and </span><span class="c1">U</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="370" src="images/image05.png" width="431"></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>Uniform initial distribution of political commitment, medium political enforcement.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>&nbsp;</span><img height="367" src="images/image11.png" width="427"></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>Uniform initial distribution of political commitment, low political enforcement.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We then moved on to testing scenarios with equally small initial amounts of changers and keepers. With low political enforcement levels and random happiness levels, there is little resistance to the rapid growth of the opposition movement, whereas the growth rate of the keepers is much lower due to low support from the government. The changers movement gai</span><span>ns even more momentum if we lower the overall happiness levels. If the country has a relatively happy population, on the other hand, agents will be more likely to join the keepers party and the opposition movement will fail to expand. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>&nbsp;</span><img height="366" src="images/image01.png" width="426"></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>Equally low initial values of changers and keepers, low happiness, low political enforcement.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>As agents do not have a mechanism to reverse their choice once they have decided to become changers or keepers, the model always ends in equilibrium conditions. An intriguing pattern we observed in the results is that the number of keepers at the end of the model displays a much stronger correlation to the initial political enforcement value than does the number of changers. This likely results from the form of the exponential curve that we chose for the government reaction. Even when initial political enforcement values are high, the government reaction will stay low until the changers have grown to a certain size. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="369" src="images/image02.png" width="429"></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>Final amount of keepers plotted against political enforcement values.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="368" src="images/image06.png" width="429"></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>Final amount of changers plotted against political enforcement values</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>We were especially interested in testing initial conditions and parameter values that replicate the situations in which revolutionary movements develop in the real world. In many cases, these are countries with relatively high levels of political repression and an already established pro-government political party. Interestingly enough, in these scenarios, the fact that one group is slightly ahead of the other leads to a fast reaction to revert the situation. In the example below, the initial fast growth of the changers movement leads them to outnumber the keepers, until the response of the government levels out the growth and allows the keepers to overtake them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="371" src="images/image04.png" width="432"></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>Established keepers party, low initial number of changers, medium enforcement.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>If we lower the initial size of changers only slightly, the government response begins to limit their growth sooner, meanwhile pushing the keepers to recruit more and more agents from the undecided population. </span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><img height="365" src="images/image10.png" width="425"></p><p class="c2 c4"><span>Established keepers party, low initial number of changers, medium enforcement.</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Comments</span></p><p class="c5 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We think our model has the potential to provide some insights into the dynamics of the spread of revolutionary movements, and especially on how the varying intensity of government response can interact with their growth.
