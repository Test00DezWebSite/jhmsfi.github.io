Research Choices Within and Between Disciplines

<p>

<li> We are interested in coming up with models that explain certain patterns in research. Some of the patterns that we are trying to replicate are the booms and busts in popularity of certain research topics and also the rare event of a topic becoming so popular that it takes over a given discipline. We further try to model re- search choices based on an individualâ€™s characteristics and try to explain the recent trend in interdisciplinary research by analyzing if there are easy short term gains from choosing to do interdisciplinary work even if it does not appear to be the obvious choice in terms of popularity of the different disciplines.
