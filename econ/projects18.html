<title> Student Projects, 2018 </title>

<h3> 2018 Graduate Workshop in Complexity and Computational Social Science</h3>

<h2> Student Projects </h2>

<hr> <hr> <p> Each student began a research project during the two-week
workshop.  Below are brief descriptions of these various projects.
These projects will form the basis for dissertation chapters and
journal articles.
 
<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Ronan Arthur, Behavioral science - epidemiology	, Stanford University	(rarthur@stanford.edu).
</h4>
Ronan is analyzing how epidemics are influenced by endogenous changes in behavior.  When an outbreak occurs, 
individuals may alter their behavior by, say, limiting their interactions with others or wearing 
protective clothing.  To study this system he modifies a standard SIR model to allow for
endogenous contact rates and finds that the resulting system is isomorphic to a well-known population dynamic 
model.  He then extended his model, using computational techniques, to allow agents to have heterogenous contact rates and finds that
a variety of equilibria can ensue depending on the contact regime.

Zackary Dunivin, Complex Systems, Indiana University (zackaryodunivin@gmail.com).
</h4>
 Zack wants to understand how individuals 
 get involved in radical groups such as the White Nationalists.  Using data from social networks like Twitter and
 Reddit, he applied various standard techniques to uncover key markers of such groups.  In the data sets explored,
 these techniques failed to yield a compact set of markers, which may suggest a key structural difference of these
 groups from other well-studied communities.  Zack is now developing new methods to identify better high-content 
 posts that can serve as a more focused sample for applyting existing methodologies.
 
<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Qi Hao, Communication, Michigan State University (hao.qi1988@hotmail.com).
</h4>
 Qi wants to understand how information---spread across individuals in a group---can 
 be used to generate knowledge.  He begins by exploring the ability of a group to derive the
 needed knowledge given how the information is held by the agents and the order in which the agents
 contribute their information.  He finds that these two factors can have a dramatic influence on
 the success of the group.  The basic model can be extended to incorporate other issues, for example, 
 when the revelation of one piece of information induces the revelation of another.
 
<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Jeff Jacobs, Political Science, Columbia University (jpj2122@columbia.edu).
 </h4>
 Jeff is focused on innovation and influence in the development of ideologies.  
 Using recently developed information-theoretic techniques (modified for the potential for texts being
 released simultaneously), he identifies whether newly introduced texts are novel given what has
 been said before, and whether their influence persists on into the future.  Using texts from the
 literature surrounding the development of Marxism, he is able to identify key texts that both
 were novel and persistent (for example, Lenin's "State and Revolution" published in 1917).
 
<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Kirbi Joe, Mathematical Behavioral Science, University of California, Irvine (kirbijoe@gamil.com).
</h4>
 Kirbi is interested in evaluating theories focused on how different groups of individuals come to a common understanding 
 about how to label different colors.  There are two major hypotheses focused on this issue.
The partition hypothesis suggests that all languages evolve down a similar path with broad, inclusive categories, that 
 are refined over time.   The emergence hypothesis implies that color categories arise
 out of necessity, implying gaps for less pragmatic colors.
 Kirbi has developed computational models of these processes and is exploring how factors, such as the number of initial
 focal colors and color terms, influence the evolution of this system.
 
<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Jared Joseph, Sociology, University of California, Davis (jnjoseph@ucdavis.edu).
</h4>
 Jared is looking at how syndicated crime altered the structure of Chicago's society from 1900 to 1933.  Using archival data
 he was able to generate a variety of potentially key networks, including relationships between known criminals, 
 law enforcement officers, politicians, and so on.  Using newly developed techniques that consider multiplex networks, he finds
 that key events, such as the introduction of prohibition, result in dramatic changes in the resulting communities.  Such techniques
 allow the identification of various communities, levels of corruptions, and other factors, providing new insights into this historical
 period.
 
<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Selcan Mutgan, Analytical Sociology, Institute for Analytical Sociology, Link√∂ping University	 (selcan.mutgan@liu.se).
</h4>
 Selcan is developing models of school segregation and calibrating them using data collected in Sweden from 2008 to 2012.  
 The first part of her analysis used data from around 200,000 students to generate a discrete choice model of the decision to 
 enroll in a school based on various school characteristics, such as the distance to a school and its
 cultural composition.  She finds that immigrant choices are driven
 by very different factors than those of non-immigrants.  She then calibrates an agent-based model using the data and explores 
 the impact of various interventions, for example, the impact on the level of segregation if the cost of traveling to the schools
 was reduced.
 
<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Matthew Oldham, Economics and Computational Social Science, George Mason University (oldhamma@gmail.com).
</h4>
 Matt is exploring a computational model of the connections and feedbacks that occur between equity markets and firms.
 In the model, firms make decisions about how to allocate their resources and these decisions impact the firm's earnings and 
 other fundamental characteristics.
 Simultaneously, investors make decisions about whether to buy or sell shares of each firm based on its characteristics.  The resulting
equity prices flow throughout the system, feeding back on the subsequent decisions of both firms and investors.  Early versions of
 the model appear to be replicating key features of real markets.
  
<p> <hr> <p> <h4> 
Alessandra Romani, International Political Economy, Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, (alessandra.romani@graduateinstitute.ch).
</h4>
 Alessandra is using computational models to explore the behavior of nations deciding whether to honor their sovereign debt obligations.  
 The resulting model extends existing models by incorporating new elements drawn from
 political economy and the behavioral theory of choice under uncertainty.  The current version of the model is able to
 generate some key real-world patterns.  She is currently refining the model's structure and calibrating it using
 empirical observations. 
 
<p> <hr> <p> <h4>
Michael Thompson, Political Science, University of Michigan (mrthomp@umich.edu).
</h4>
Mike wants to understand policy innovation under uncertainty.  The model focuses on how a local government can adapt its decision
 rules for implementing policies.  Each policy has both a direct local benefit and a potential externality.  Local governments
 are willing to trade off increased local benefits for negative externalities, while the central government wants to avoid externalities.
 Early results indicate that in environments characterized by higher uncertainty, local governments tend to be 
more accepting of potential policy risks.
