What happens?

<ul>
   <li> Explicitly state your model and key assumptions.
   <li> Summarize key results.
   <li> Suggest some potentially interesting future directions and
questions for the model.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Suggest some standard social science scenarios that could be
usefully modeled using such a process.
