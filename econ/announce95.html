<hr>


The Economics Program at the Santa Fe Institute is pleased to announce
the first Graduate Workshop in Computational Economics. The workshop
will bring together a group of advanced graduate students and a small
faculty for an intensive two week study of computational economics.
The workshop will consist of lectures by faculty, special topic
seminars by members of the Santa Fe Institute, and presentations of
work in progress by graduate student participants.  The primary goal of
the summer workshop is to assist graduate students pursuing research
agendas which include a computational component. A significant portion
of the workshop will be devoted to analyzing and improving research
being conducted by the graduate student participants.

<p>
Participation at the workshop will be limited to twelve graduate
students.  Travel, accommodations, and living expenses for the students
will be covered by the Economics Program at the Santa Fe Institute.
Applicants should have completed a minimum of two years of  graduate
study in economics and be actively pursuing research in computational
economics.  Interested students should submit a recent curriculum
vitae,  at least one letter of recommendation, two references, and a
one page outline of a current or proposed research project in
computational economics.  Preference will be given to applicants who
best demonstrate the ability to successfully complete research in the
area of computational economics.
