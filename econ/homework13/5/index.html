Risking Reputations: when to endorse new drugs?

<li> We explore the strategies doctors might adopt to manage their
  reputation when faced with the choice of publicly adopting a new
  prescription drug. In particular we ask whether doctors should
  choose to be forerunners on taking a public stance early on in the
  drug experimentation process, risking their reputation at first, but
  with the prospect of eventually gaining much credit for having been
  perceptive before the crowd. We thus explore the waiting times
  until drug adoption that doctors learn, and whether these waiting
  times come to depend on reputation and on the riskiness of the drug.
