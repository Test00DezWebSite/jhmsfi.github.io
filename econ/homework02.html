Consider the following situation:

<p>

A group of, say, 20 reporters is attempting to uncover the details
of an unfolding scandal.  How does the news of this event get reported 
over time?

<p>

<li>
Model, using whatever techniques you wish, the formation of the
groups.
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Explicitly state your model and key assumptions.
   <li> Summarize any results.
   <li> Suggest some potentially interesting future directions and
questions for
        the model.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Suggest some standard social science scenarios that could be
usefully modeled
using such a process.
